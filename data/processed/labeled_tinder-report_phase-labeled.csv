Abstract,Formatting,Formatting,Support – Formatting
Tinder is a dating app that is being used by many users on a global scale. The Tinder application requires a Facebook profile as well as GPS location to function properly. Tinder claims not to share this information with other users. Since personal information like sexual preferences or your location is highly sensitive data it should be properly secured. This audit focuses on testing whether or not Tinder uses avail- able technologies to withstand common attacks. Whilst most known leaks in Tinder appear to no longer be around there are still some points of concern. It turns out that there is an insecure connection which sends user preferences and GPS data to an analytics company. ,Sensitive Data Exposure,Sensitive Data Exposure,Exploitation – Sensitive Data Exposure

"Dating apps are common place in society. Many dating apps include the option to contact matched users and send text messages or images. Due to the amount of personal information potentially involved in the matchmaking process this a prime target for identity theft.

3.2.1 HTTP(S) Proxies,Formatting,Formatting,Support – Formatting
 To complete our MitM setup we needed to proxy HTTP(S) requests and fake certificates for the various requested web resources. Because we wanted to analyze all requests we chose to set our proxy in transparent setup as opposed to defining the proxy in the WiFi settings. Reason for this is that applications on Android don't use the proxy as configured in the WiFi settings. As such we required a proxy which could generate SSL certificates for the various end-points requested by the application. ,Weak Transport Security,Recon / Analysis Method,Discovery – Recon / Analysis Method
First we used the Burp suite[5]. This program sat as a proxy between,Unknown,Unknown,Unlabeled – Unknown
