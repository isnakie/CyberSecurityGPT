20,,,MITRE,"Improper Input Validation. The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.
Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. Input can consist of: raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc. metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data. Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as: specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc. implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc. well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be) consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc. conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation.
::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks. Multiple techniques exist to transform potentially dangerous input into something safe, which is different than validation, which is a technique to check if an input is already safe. CWE users need to be cautious during root cause analysis to ensure that an issue is truly an input-validation problem.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:The input validation term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships. Some people use input validation as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, i.e., attempting to remove dangerous inputs (related to CWE-790); encoding/escaping, i.e., attempting to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component (related to CWE-116); or canonicalization, which often indirectly removes otherwise-dangerous inputs. Others use the term in a narrower context to simply mean checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it. CWE uses this narrow interpretation. Note that input validation has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred. Developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name O'Reilly would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the ' apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic. If a programmer believes that an attacker cannot modify certain inputs, then the programmer might not perform any input validation at all. For example, in web applications, many programmers believe that cookies and hidden form fields can not be modified from a web browser (CWE-472), although they can be altered using a proxy or a custom program. In a client-server architecture, the programmer might assume that client-side security checks cannot be bypassed, even when a custom client could be written that skips those checks (CWE-602).::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):NOTE:An attacker could provide unexpected values and cause a program crash or arbitrary control of resource allocation, leading to excessive consumption of resources such as memory and CPU.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:NOTE:An attacker could read confidential data if they are able to control resource references.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:An attacker could use malicious input to modify data or possibly alter control flow in unexpected ways, including arbitrary command execution.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:DESCRIPTION:Consider using language-theoretic security (LangSec) techniques that characterize inputs using a formal language and build recognizers for that language. This effectively requires parsing to be a distinct layer that effectively enforces a boundary between raw input and internal data representations, instead of allowing parser code to be scattered throughout the program, where it could be subject to errors or inconsistencies that create weaknesses. [REF-1109] [REF-1110] [REF-1111]::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use an input validation framework such as Struts or the OWASP ESAPI Validation API. Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:DESCRIPTION:Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter the product, including but not limited to: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server. Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to server-side security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but violate the intended restrictions after they have been combined.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger an overflow.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the input's values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies are maintained.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control. Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.::. Detection: ::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Some instances of improper input validation can be detected using automated static analysis. A static analysis tool might allow the user to specify which application-specific methods or functions perform input validation; the tool might also have built-in knowledge of validation frameworks such as Struts. The tool may then suppress or de-prioritize any associated warnings. This allows the analyst to focus on areas of the software in which input validation does not appear to be present. Except in the cases described in the previous paragraph, automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:When custom input validation is required, such as when enforcing business rules, manual analysis is necessary to ensure that the validation is properly implemented.::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzzing techniques can be useful for detecting input validation errors. When unexpected inputs are provided to the software, the software should not crash or otherwise become unstable, and it should generate application-controlled error messages. If exceptions or interpreter-generated error messages occur, this indicates that the input was not detected and handled within the application logic itself.::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis Binary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Web Application Scanner Web Services Scanner Database Scanners:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Fuzz Tester Framework-based Fuzzer Cost effective for partial coverage: Host Application Interface Scanner Monitored Virtual Environment - run potentially malicious code in sandbox / wrapper / virtual machine, see if it does anything suspicious:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source Manual Source Code Review (not inspections):EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Source code Weakness Analyzer Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.) Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction Cost effective for partial coverage: Attack Modeling:EFFECTIVENESS:High::.

22,,,MITRE,"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as .. and / separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ../ sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as /usr/local/bin to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.
::TYPE:Other:NOTE:In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add .txt to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing / on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use directory traversal only to refer to the injection of .. and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories. Other variants like absolute pathname and drive letter have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve .. or equivalent.::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that .. is vulnerable, but not test ../ which may also be vulnerable. Any combination of directory separators (/, , etc.) and numbers of . (e.g. ....) can produce unique variants; for example, the //../ variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Implementation::.

This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single . character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as / to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434. Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering / is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if ../ sequences are removed from the .../...// string in a sequential fashion, two instances of ../ would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the ../ string.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602.

Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes .. sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59).

If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Enforcement by Conversion:DESCRIPTION:When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs. For example, ID 1 could map to inbox.txt and ID 2 could map to profile.txt. Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-185] provide this capability.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Sandbox or Jail:DESCRIPTION:Run the code in a jail or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software. OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations. This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise. Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:DESCRIPTION:Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately. This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success. If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not. In the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.::PHASE:Operation Implementation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals.

The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.
Many protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.
::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:The command injection phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of command injection refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages. In vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize command injection. However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness. To some, command injection can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed. CWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:Command injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Command injection vulnerabilities typically occur when: Data enters the application from an untrusted source.

As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes.

78,,,MITRE,"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'). The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.
This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage. There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection: The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(nslookup [HOSTNAME]) to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing. The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use exec([COMMAND]) to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line. From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.
::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:The OS command injection phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an -exec switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX find command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::.

For example, in web applications, this may require storing the data locally in the session's state instead of sending it out to the client in a hidden form field.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [REF-45] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Output Encoding:DESCRIPTION:While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:If the program to be executed allows arguments to be specified within an input file or from standard input, then consider using that mode to pass arguments instead of the command line.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Parameterization:DESCRIPTION:If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated. Some languages offer multiple functions that can be used to invoke commands. Where possible, identify any function that invokes a command shell using a single string, and replace it with a function that requires individual arguments. These functions typically perform appropriate quoting and filtering of arguments. For example, in C, the system() function accepts a string that contains the entire command to be executed, whereas execl(), execve(), and others require an array of strings, one for each argument. In Windows, CreateProcess() only accepts one command at a time. In Perl, if system() is provided with an array of arguments, then it will quote each of the arguments.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules.

Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When constructing OS command strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping. Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing OS command injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent OS command injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, when invoking a mail program, you might need to allow the subject field to contain otherwise-dangerous inputs like ; and > characters, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the character might reduce the risk of OS command injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the subject field would not be recorded as the user intended. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it could be more important when the program relies on well-structured subject lines in order to pass messages to other components. Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Enforcement by Conversion:DESCRIPTION:When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's -T switch.

79,,,MITRE,"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
There are many variants of cross-site scripting, characterized by a variety of terms or involving different attack topologies. However, they all indicate the same fundamental weakness: improper neutralization of dangerous input between the adversary and a victim.
::The Same Origin Policy states that browsers should limit the resources accessible to scripts running on a given web site, or origin, to the resources associated with that web site on the client-side, and not the client-side resources of any other sites or origins. The goal is to prevent one site from being able to modify or read the contents of an unrelated site. Since the World Wide Web involves interactions between many sites, this policy is important for browsers to enforce. When referring to XSS, the Domain of a website is roughly equivalent to the resources associated with that website on the client-side of the connection. That is, the domain can be thought of as all resources the browser is storing for the user's interactions with this particular site.::
::TYPE:Other:NOTE:The attack methods for XSS can vary depending on the type of XSS and the attacker’s goal. Reflected XSS exploits (Type 1) occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser. In a Stored XSS exploit (Type 2), the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. DOM-based XSS (Type 0) generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as JavaScript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:Attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when: Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.::TYPE:Applicable Platform:NOTE:XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of private information stored in user cookies, such as session information. Typically, a malicious user will craft a client-side script, which -- when parsed by a web browser -- performs some activity on behalf of the victim to an attacker-controlled system (such as sending all site cookies to a given E-mail address). This could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. This script will be loaded and run by each user visiting the web site. Since the site requesting to run the script has access to the cookies in question, the malicious script does also.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:In some circumstances it may be possible to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer when cross-site scripting is combined with other flaws, for example, drive-by hacking.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is stored or reflected. The difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. Some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes. Other damaging attacks include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, running Active X controls (under Microsoft Internet Explorer) from sites that a user perceives as trustworthy, and modifying presentation of content.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly encoded output include Microsoft's Anti-XSS library, the OWASP ESAPI Encoding module, and Apache Wicket.::PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies. For any data that will be output to another web page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding on all non-alphanumeric characters. Parts of the same output document may require different encodings, which will vary depending on whether the output is in the: HTML body Element attributes (such as src=XYZ) URIs JavaScript sections Cascading Style Sheets and style property etc. Note that HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body. Consult the XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet [REF-724] for more details on the types of encoding and escaping that are needed.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:DESCRIPTION:Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Parameterization:DESCRIPTION:If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Output Encoding:DESCRIPTION:Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component. The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:With Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:DESCRIPTION:To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended. Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon (<3) would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the < character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the < might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities. Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address. Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Enforcement by Conversion:DESCRIPTION:When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY:Firewall:DESCRIPTION:Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::PHASE:Operation Implementation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals.

[REF-867]::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations. Specifically, follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. The database users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others' data. Use the strictest permissions possible on all database objects, such as execute-only for stored procedures.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Output Encoding:DESCRIPTION:While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88). Instead of building a new implementation, such features may be available in the database or programming language. For example, the Oracle DBMS_ASSERT package can check or enforce that parameters have certain properties that make them less vulnerable to SQL injection. For MySQL, the mysql_real_escape_string() API function is available in both C and PHP.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules.

Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When constructing SQL query strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping. Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing SQL injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent SQL injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, the name O'Reilly would likely pass the validation step, since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the ' apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded. When feasible, it may be safest to disallow meta-characters entirely, instead of escaping them. This will provide some defense in depth. After the data is entered into the database, later processes may neglect to escape meta-characters before use, and you may not have control over those processes.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Enforcement by Conversion:DESCRIPTION:When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else.

Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success. If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files. Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.

94,,,MITRE,"Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'). The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:In some cases, injectable code controls authentication; this may lead to a remote vulnerability.::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Injected code can access resources that the attacker is directly prevented from accessing.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:When a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. As a result, code injection can often result in the execution of arbitrary code. Code injection attacks can also lead to loss of data integrity in nearly all cases, since the control-plane data injected is always incidental to data recall or writing.::SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:IMPACT:Hide Activities:NOTE:Often the actions performed by injected control code are unlogged.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Refactor your program so that you do not have to dynamically generate code.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Run your code in a jail or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which code can be executed by your product. Examples include the Unix chroot jail and AppArmor. In general, managed code may provide some protection. This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be subject to compromise. Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. To reduce the likelihood of code injection, use stringent allowlists that limit which constructs are allowed. If you are dynamically constructing code that invokes a function, then verifying that the input is alphanumeric might be insufficient. An attacker might still be able to reference a dangerous function that you did not intend to allow, such as system(), exec(), or exit().::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's -T switch. This will force the program to perform validation steps that remove the taint, although you must be careful to correctly validate your inputs so that you do not accidentally mark dangerous inputs as untainted (see CWE-183 and CWE-184).::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's -T switch.

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.
::Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced.::

Consequences: ::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code, as with a standard buffer overflow. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can alter the intended control flow by redirecting a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an administrator.::SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):NOTE:Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash.

If the sensitive information contains system details, such as the current buffer's position in memory, this knowledge can be used to craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY:Language Selection:DESCRIPTION:Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer. Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.::PHASE:Operation Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory: Double check that the buffer is as large as specified. When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space. If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.::PHASE:Operation Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as rebasing (for Windows) and prelinking (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.

190,,,MITRE,"Integer Overflow or Wraparound. The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may become a very small or negative number.

::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Integer overflow is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains. A wraparound is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11. Overflow is sometimes conflated with wraparound but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior. The overflow term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use overflow to indicate exceeding the maximum while using underflow for exceeding the minimum. Some people use overflow to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses underflow for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum. See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:This weakness may become security critical when determining the offset or size in behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, and concatenation.::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Instability:NOTE:This weakness can generally lead to undefined behavior and therefore crashes. When the calculated result is used for resource allocation, this weakness can cause too many (or too few) resources to be allocated, possibly enabling crashes if the product requests more resources than can be provided.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also, if the overflow/wraparound results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of the product's implicit security policy.::SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):NOTE:If the overflow/wraparound occurs in a loop index variable, this could cause the loop to terminate at the wrong time - too early, too late, or not at all (i.e., infinite loops). With too many iterations, some loops could consume too many resources such as memory, file handles, etc., possibly leading to a crash or other DoS.::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:If integer values are used in security-critical decisions, such as calculating quotas or allocation limits, integer overflows can be used to cause an incorrect security decision.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all protocols are strictly defined, such that all out-of-bounds behavior can be identified simply, and require strict conformance to the protocol.::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY:Language Selection:DESCRIPTION:Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. If possible, choose a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Use libraries or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences. Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++). [REF-106]::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range. Use unsigned integers where possible. This makes it easier to perform validation for integer overflows. When signed integers are required, ensure that the range check includes minimum values as well as maximum values.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Understand the programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, not-a-number calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7] Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.::.

200,,,MITRE,"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include: private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages business secrets and intellectual property network status and configuration the product's own code or internal state metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include: the product's own users people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates the developer Information exposures can occur in different ways: the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been scrubbed or sanitized a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program. the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place. It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an information exposure, but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.
::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality.

The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources. Likelihood: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.::PHASE:Operation:NOTE:When migrating data to the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), there is a risk of losing the protections that were originally provided by hosting on internal networks. If access does not require authentication, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:Exposing critical functionality essentially provides an attacker with the privilege level of that functionality. The consequences will depend on the associated functionality, but they can range from reading or modifying sensitive data, accessing administrative or other privileged functionality, or possibly even executing arbitrary code.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability. Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port. In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Where possible, avoid implementing custom, grow-your-own authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks. In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, consider using libraries with authentication capabilities such as OpenSSL or the ESAPI Authenticator [REF-45].::PHASE:Implementation System Configuration Operation:DESCRIPTION:When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to require strong authentication for users who should be allowed to access the data [REF-1297] [REF-1298] [REF-1302].::.

::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:The CSRF topology is multi-channel: Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel. Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::.

An attacker could trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc., which would then be treated as an authentic request from the client - effectively performing any operations as the victim, leading to an exposure of data, unintended code execution, etc. If the victim is an administrator or privileged user, the consequences may include obtaining complete control over the web application - deleting or stealing data, uninstalling the product, or using it to launch other attacks against all of the product's users. Because the attacker has the identity of the victim, the scope of CSRF is limited only by the victim's privileges.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, use anti-CSRF packages such as the OWASP CSRFGuard. [REF-330] Another example is the ESAPI Session Management control, which includes a component for CSRF. [REF-45]::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that the application is free of cross-site scripting issues (CWE-79), because most CSRF defenses can be bypassed using attacker-controlled script.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Generate a unique nonce for each form, place the nonce into the form, and verify the nonce upon receipt of the form. Be sure that the nonce is not predictable (CWE-330). [REF-332]::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Identify especially dangerous operations. When the user performs a dangerous operation, send a separate confirmation request to ensure that the user intended to perform that operation.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use the double-submitted cookie method as described by Felten and Zeller: When a user visits a site, the site should generate a pseudorandom value and set it as a cookie on the user's machine. The site should require every form submission to include this value as a form value and also as a cookie value. When a POST request is sent to the site, the request should only be considered valid if the form value and the cookie value are the same. Because of the same-origin policy, an attacker cannot read or modify the value stored in the cookie. To successfully submit a form on behalf of the user, the attacker would have to correctly guess the pseudorandom value. If the pseudorandom value is cryptographically strong, this will be prohibitively difficult. This technique requires Javascript, so it may not work for browsers that have Javascript disabled.

Specifically, manual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, and for minimizing false positives assuming an understanding of business logic. However, it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. For black-box analysis, if credentials are not known for privileged accounts, then the most security-critical portions of the application may not receive sufficient attention. Consider using OWASP CSRFTester to identify potential issues and aid in manual analysis.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:CSRF is currently difficult to detect reliably using automated techniques. This is because each application has its own implicit security policy that dictates which requests can be influenced by an outsider and automatically performed on behalf of a user, versus which requests require strong confidence that the user intends to make the request.

400,,,MITRE,"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource.

::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Resource consumption could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. Resource exhaustion can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request. A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to macof attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks. Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, CPU, and others.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the Mapping CWE to 62443 subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Operation:NOTE:The product could be operated in a system or environment with lower resource limits than expected, which might make it easier for attackers to consume all available resources.::PHASE:System Configuration:NOTE:The product could be configured with lower resource limits than expected, which might make it easier for attackers to consume all available resources.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:The designer might not consider how to handle and throttle excessive resource requests, which typically requires careful planning to handle more gracefully than a crash or exit.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:There are at least three distinct scenarios that can commonly lead to resource exhaustion: Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources. Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage. Not closing/returning a resource after processing. Resource exhaustion problems often occur due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations: Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances. Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):NOTE:If an attacker can trigger the allocation of the limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the most common result is denial of service. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment, i.e., the product may slow down, crash due to unhandled errors, or lock out legitimate users. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:In some cases it may be possible to force the product to fail open in the event of resource exhaustion. The state of the product -- and possibly the security functionality - may then be compromised.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Mitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either: recognizes the attack and denies that user further access for a given amount of time, or uniformly throttles all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed. The first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user. If the attacker impersonates the valid user, they may be able to prevent the user from accessing the server in question. The second solution is simply difficult to effectively institute -- and even when properly done, it does not provide a full solution. It simply makes the attack require more resources on the part of the attacker.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale placed on them.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all failures in resource allocation place the system into a safe posture.::. Detection: ::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis typically has limited utility in recognizing resource exhaustion problems, except for program-independent system resources such as files, sockets, and processes. For system resources, automated static analysis may be able to detect circumstances in which resources are not released after they have expired. Automated analysis of configuration files may be able to detect settings that do not specify a maximum value. Automated static analysis tools will not be appropriate for detecting exhaustion of custom resources, such as an intended security policy in which a bulletin board user is only allowed to make a limited number of posts per day.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::METHOD:Automated Dynamic Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Certain automated dynamic analysis techniques may be effective in spotting resource exhaustion problems, especially with resources such as processes, memory, and connections. The technique may involve generating a large number of requests to the product within a short time frame.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:While fuzzing is typically geared toward finding low-level implementation bugs, it can inadvertently find resource exhaustion problems. This can occur when the fuzzer generates a large number of test cases but does not restart the targeted product in between test cases. If an individual test case produces a crash, but it does not do so reliably, then an inability to handle resource exhaustion may be the cause.:EFFECTIVENESS:Opportunistic::.

Then, use other mechanisms to deliver the files dynamically. [REF-423]::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. For example, limiting filenames to alphanumeric characters can help to restrict the introduction of unintended file extensions.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Define a very limited set of allowable extensions and only generate filenames that end in these extensions.

Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not rely exclusively on sanity checks of file contents to ensure that the file is of the expected type and size. It may be possible for an attacker to hide code in some file segments that will still be executed by the server. For example, GIF images may contain a free-form comments field.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not rely exclusively on the MIME content type or filename attribute when determining how to render a file. Validating the MIME content type and ensuring that it matches the extension is only a partial solution.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Sandbox or Jail:DESCRIPTION:Run the code in a jail or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system.

OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.

502,,,MITRE,"Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.
::Serialization and deserialization refer to the process of taking program-internal object-related data, packaging it in a way that allows the data to be externally stored or transferred (serialization), then extracting the serialized data to reconstruct the original object (deserialization).::
::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.:: Likelihood: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Implementation::. Consequences: ::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Unexpected State:NOTE:Attackers can modify unexpected objects or data that was assumed to be safe from modification. Deserialized data or code could be modified without using the provided accessor functions, or unexpected functions could be invoked.::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):NOTE:If a function is making an assumption on when to terminate, based on a sentry in a string, it could easily never terminate.::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:The consequences can vary widely, because it depends on which objects or methods are being deserialized, and how they are used. Making an assumption that the code in the deserialized object is valid is dangerous and can enable exploitation. One example is attackers using gadget chains to perform unauthorized actions, such as generating a shell.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:If available, use the signing/sealing features of the programming language to assure that deserialized data has not been tainted. For example, a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) could be used to ensure that data has not been modified.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When deserializing data, populate a new object rather than just deserializing. The result is that the data flows through safe input validation and that the functions are safe.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Explicitly define a final object() to prevent deserialization.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Make fields transient to protect them from deserialization. An attempt to serialize and then deserialize a class containing transient fields will result in NULLs where the transient data should be. This is an excellent way to prevent time, environment-based, or sensitive variables from being carried over and used improperly.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Avoid having unnecessary types or gadgets (a sequence of instances and method invocations that can self-execute during the deserialization process, often found in libraries) available that can be leveraged for malicious ends. This limits the potential for unintended or unauthorized types and gadgets to be leveraged by the attacker. Add only acceptable classes to an allowlist. Note: new gadgets are constantly being discovered, so this alone is not a sufficient mitigation.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Employ cryptography of the data or code for protection. However, it's important to note that it would still be client-side security. This is risky because if the client is compromised then the security implemented on the client (the cryptography) can be bypassed.::.

Mitigations: ::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY:Language Selection:DESCRIPTION:Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer. Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.::PHASE:Operation Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory: Double check that the buffer is as large as specified. When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space. If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.::PHASE:Operation Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as rebasing (for Windows) and prelinking (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Use a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment. For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::. Detection: ::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives. Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Dynamic Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection.

There are two main variations: Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect. Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered.

In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a first login mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash. Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete. The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords or keys that are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals. Next, the passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access. Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.::. Detection: ::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:Credential storage in configuration files is findable using black box methods, but the use of hard-coded credentials for an incoming authentication routine typically involves an account that is not visible outside of the code.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated white box techniques have been published for detecting hard-coded credentials for incoming authentication, but there is some expert disagreement regarding their effectiveness and applicability to a broad range of methods.::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness may be detectable using manual code analysis. Unless authentication is decentralized and applied throughout the product, there can be sufficient time for the analyst to find incoming authentication routines and examine the program logic looking for usage of hard-coded credentials. Configuration files could also be analyzed.::METHOD:Manual Dynamic Analysis:DESCRIPTION:For hard-coded credentials in incoming authentication: use monitoring tools that examine the product's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the product was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic. Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Using call trees or similar artifacts from the output, examine the associated behaviors and see if any of them appear to be comparing the input to a fixed string or value.::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis Binary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Network Sniffer Forced Path Execution:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source Manual Source Code Review (not inspections):EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Source code Weakness Analyzer Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Configuration Checker:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.) Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction:EFFECTIVENESS:High::.

Consequences: ::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.::. Mitigations: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:
Restrict which URLs and domains the server can access. Deny requests to internal resources (e.g., 127.0.0.1, localhost, internal IP ranges) and restrict outbound connections unless absolutely necessary.::
::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:
Use network-level access controls (firewalls, VPCs, security groups) to block server access to internal services that should not be reachable via HTTP.::
::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:
Design systems so that servers responsible for making requests to other services are separated from sensitive internal services using network segmentation.::
::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:
Define strict security requirements for any feature that accepts URLs or makes outbound HTTP requests. Include rules for allowed schemes, IP address ranges, and ports.::
::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:
Sanitize and validate all user-supplied URLs. Ensure they do not resolve to internal addresses, non-HTTP schemes (like file://), or loopback interfaces.::
::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:
Use DNS resolution and IP range validation to verify that user-controlled inputs do not point to private or restricted IP spaces.::
::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:
Disable redirects and restrict response handling when making HTTP requests from the backend server. SSRF can exploit automatic redirection.::
::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:
Avoid exposing raw server-side fetch APIs directly to user input without authentication, validation, and filtering mechanisms.::
::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:
Deploy monitoring and alerting systems to detect unusual outbound requests or SSRF scanning behavior.::
::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:
Apply least privilege principle for the web server and any services it communicates with. Services should have no access to internal metadata or sensitive services unless required.::
::PHASE:Build and Installation:DESCRIPTION:
Ensure secure default configurations by disabling unnecessary services and interfaces that may be targeted via SSRF.::
::PHASE:Build and Installation:DESCRIPTION:
Patch and update libraries or frameworks that may expose SSRF vectors (e.g., URL fetchers, HTTP clients).::. Detection: ::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::.

Physically check that crypto equipment, keys, and keyed crypto are handled and stored properly. Reviewers must annotate specific types of crypto devices observed in the finding details or comments, (e.g. TACLANE, KIV 7, etc.) Fix: COMSEC material must be stored in a GSA approved container such as safe, vault, or secure room IAW (NSA/CSS Policy Manual 3-16, Section XI, paragraph 89). Specific standards are:  1. Keyed crypto equipment must be housed within a proper GSA safe, vault or secure room.  2. If crypto equipment is not housed within a proper GSA safe, vault or secure room the Crypto Encryption Key must be removed and stored in a GSA approved safe or in a separate room from the crypto equipment when the equipment is not under the continuous observation and control of a properly cleared person.  3. Information Processing System (IPS) containers (safes) may be used to securely store and operate keyed equipment.  4. If unclassified crypto equipment is not operated in a safe, vault or secure room it must minimally be maintained within an approved Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA) and further secured in a locked room (equipment closet) or equipment rack suitable for control of sensitive equipment to ensure only system administrator and COMSEC personnel have access to the equipment.  5. NOTES: This requirement applies to a tactical environment. Unless under continuous observation and control, Crypto Equipment Key must be removed and maintained separately from the encryption device - unless it is operated in a proper safe, vault or secure room.  Ensure that any COMSEC account, materials or equipment being inspected is used for encryption of DoDIN assets.  COMSEC items not used with DoDIN assets should not be inspected.

If it is a mobile tactical organization, responsibility for program management might simply be the identification of an individual responsible for keeping track of and maintaining COMSEC materials, but supporting documentation may not be immediately available and should not be written as a finding; however, observations and comments may still be documented.   2. Note in the report the COMSEC Account type e.g. NSA, Navy, Army, etc.   3. Note in the report the last COMSEC Inspection Date based on observed documentation. (Summarize the overall results and if the site is taking action to address/correct findings.)   4. Ensure that any COMSEC account, materials or equipment being inspected is used for encryption of DODIN assets. COMSEC accounts or items not used with DODIN assets should not be inspected.  5. This check is not intended to be an inspection of the COMSEC Program, rather it is a verification that a viable program is in place with NSA or oversight. The idea is to ensure that NSA or Service oversight inspection findings/deficiencies are being corrected in a timely manner by the site. Fix: The site must have local procedures covering maintenance of COMSEC equipment and key material. Further, any inspection findings from NSA or Services issuing the account or the account sponsor (for Hand Receipt holders) must be corrected or provide evidence there is a plan of action in place and underway to correct noted deficiencies."

The hinge must be hidden or mechanically blocked to prevent removal.  Check 2. If the pull box will be accessed after installation, the pull box cover must be secured with an approved PDS lock. Multiple locks may be required for larger pull-boxes.    NOTE 1: The ONLY approved PDS Lock within the DoD is the General Services Administration (GSA) approved changeable combination padlock and has historically been the lock used for securing accessible pull boxes and PDS termination boxes. The only padlock currently meeting this standard is the S&G 8077, changeable combination padlock.  NOTE 2: A newer alternative PDS lock listed by the CNSSI 7003 is the tamper indicative padlock with a wire loop seal. This is a ""keyed"" padlock with an attached seal that is issued exclusively by the lock proponent, which is the National Security Agency (NSA) Information Assurance Division (IAD) Lock and Seal Office. The USD(I) has determined this lock will not be used for protecting PDS Pull Boxes within the DoD.    NOTE 3: The new CNSSI 7003 under the PDS Lock definition identified the wrong federal specification for the changeable combination padlock. The lock identified under FF-L-2740B is designed for safes and will not fit properly on a small PDS lock box. The correct lock (S&G 8077 changeable combination padlock) is under the FF-P-110J federal specification. That is what the CNSSI 7003 proponent ""intended"" and the DoD TEMPEST Advisory Group (TAG) and NSA Protective Technologies Group are taking action to coordinate correction of this oversight.  Check 3. Hasps (used with PDS locks) to secure the cover on the pull box are permanently and securely attached to the box (e.g., tack welded or with rivets) in such a way as it cannot be removed without breaking the hasp or its connection.    Check 4. Ensure boxes with prepunched knockouts are not used.  Check 5. Ensure that for medium threat areas (as defined in the CNSSI 7003), pull boxes are constructed of a ferrous metal with a minimum thickness of 14 gauge and must have a cover that can be locked. However, the material need not be thicker than the PDS carrier or the thickness needed for box rigidity.  Check 6. Ensure that for low threat areas (as defined in the CNSSI 7003), pull boxes are constructed of a ferrous metal with a minimum thickness of 16 gauge.  If pull box covers are NOT capable of being opened or used for accessing the transmission cable, the following 4 checks apply:   Check 7. Ensure covers are secured to the pull boxes by welding or epoxy after installation as follows:    - If welded, at least one weld must be applied on each side of the box and cover.    - If epoxy is used, it must be applied between all mating surfaces continuously around the cover.    - Painted surfaces must be treated to form a mechanically strong epoxy bond.  Check 8. Ensure hinge-pins for pull-box covers are non-removable. The hinge must be hidden or mechanically blocked to prevent removal.   Check 9. Boxes with pre-punched knockouts are not used under any circumstances.   Check 10. For low threat areas (as defined in the CNSSI 7003), pull boxes are constructed of a ferrous metal with a minimum thickness of 16 gauge.  NOTE: Pull boxes located in medium threat areas must have a lockable cover per the CNSSI 7003 and are therefore addressed in check #5 above under pull box covers capable of being opened and used for accessing the transmission cable. Fix: If pull box covers are capable of being opened and used for accessing the transmission cable, the following 6 requirements apply:   1. Box covers must not have removable hinge pins. The hinge must be hidden or mechanically blocked to prevent removal.   2. If the pull box will be accessed after installation, the pull box cover must be secured with an approved PDS lock.

If the Category 2 hardened carrier is buried:  1. Check to ensure the buried carrier is constructed of conduit consisting of EMT, rigid pipe, PVC, or a similar type of plastic electrical conduit. (CAT I finding)  2. Check that all connections are permanently sealed completely around all mating surfaces (e.g., welding, epoxy, fusion, or PVC glue). (CAT I finding)  3. Check to ensure it is buried a minimum of 1 meter (39 inches) below the surface and on the property (in a LOW Threat area within CONUS) owned or leased by the U.S. Government or the contractor having control of the PDS. NOTE: As an alternative, if the carrier cannot be buried to a one-meter depth due to soil conditions or blocked passage, a lesser depth may be used within a low threat area with prior approval of the Authorizing Official (AO) if the carrier is encased within the center of mass of approximately 20 centimeters (8 inches) of concrete. (CAT I finding)  4. Check that the buried carrier departs and enters a building through the building's concrete slab or basement wall. NOTE: As an alternative all portions of the PDS above the one-meter (39 inches) depth and not within a CAA (e.g., a PDS rising to a pull box on the side of a building) must meet the requirements of a Category 2 hardened carrier. (CAT I finding)   5. Check that manholes or any other access (e.g., hand hole) to the buried PDS are secured with a PDS lock or an alarm. The PDS lock must be visible for daily inspection. If a PDS lock cannot be used due to the physical construction of the manhole, then a standard locking manhole cover and micro-switch alarm should be used. NOTE: As an alternative to a PDS lock or approved micro-switch alarms, manhole covers may be completely welded around the opening surface to impede opening and provide for clear evidence of penetration. Spot-welding is not acceptable.  If operational security needs dictate exceeding the STIG requirements, the site is always free to expand upon and increase their security posture by welding manhole covers. However, prior to this alternative method being instituted, the site must conduct and document an in-depth THREAT Assessment for their AOR and the assessment requires Senior Agency Official approval. This approval will be maintained on file. Also, daily visual inspections are still required per CNSSI 7003, Section X, para b. 3. (CAT I finding)  NOTE: The USD(I) Policy has determined the PDS Locks referred to in the CNSSI 7003 as Tamper Indicative Padlock with a wire loop seal and Tamper Evident Seal ARE NOT permitted for use in the DoD. This is because neither product was properly vetted and listed by the DoD Lock Program. ONLY the SG 8077 Changeable Combination Padlock is to be used for securing Buried PDS manhole covers protecting SIPRNet within the DoD.  6. If the carrier is buried in a MEDIUM threat location, check to ensure it is buried a minimum of 1 meter (39 inches) below the surface AND be encased within the center of mass of approximately 20 centimeters (8 inches) of concrete. NOTE: A concrete and steel container of sufficient size (to preclude surreptitious penetration in a period less than two hours as confirmed by laboratory tests) may be used in lieu of the 20 centimeters (8 inches) of concrete. (CAT I finding)  NOTE for Reviewers: If portions of the buried carrier cannot be checked due to being physically inaccessible, conduct whatever physical review is possible and attempt to validate PDS construction by reviewing contract/build documents, engineering drawings or certification documents from installation engineers that contain information about the physical makeup of the buried carrier.  7. Check the PDS is not within an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA). (CAT I finding) Fix: The following requirements must be applied to Exterior PDS:  1. Ensure the buried carrier is constructed of conduit consisting of EMT, rigid pipe, PVC, or a similar type of plastic electrical conduit.    2. Ensure all connections are permanently sealed completely around all mating surfaces (e.g., welding, epoxy, fusion, or PVC glue).    3.

Suspended carriers (Exterior PDS) are a Category 2 PDS option used to extend a PDS between Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) that are located in different buildings.  Suspended carriers may be used for short runs when it is not practical to bury the PDS between buildings (e.g., between the 3rd floors of adjacent buildings).  Unlike other Category 2 PDS the unencrypted data cables are not required to be installed in a carrier. Proper elevation and ease of visibility as well as minimum daily visual inspections of suspended carriers is of paramount importance.  A PDS that is not configured, physically secured and inspected as required could result in the undetected interception of classified information.  This is especially true for unencrypted cables running through an outdoor environment where physical barriers protecting the environment are often easily breeched.

A PDS that is not constructed and configured as required could result in the undetected interception of classified information. Within mobile tactical situations a hardened carrier is not possible and therefore the unencrypted SIPRNet cable must be maintained within the confines of the tactical encampment with the cable under continuous observation and control to prevent exploitation by enemy forces. In theaters of operation where fixed facilities are well established, standard PDS applications must be employed unless a risk assessment is conducted to determine the vulnerabilities and risks associated with using unencrypted cable that is not in a hardened carrier.

Check: An Alarmed PDS is one of five types of Category 2 PDS IAW the CNSSI 7003. It is a suitable alternative for the two types of interior PDS, which are Hardened Carrier or Continuously Viewed Carrier. It should be used when the unencrypted data transmission line is concealed above suspended ceilings, below raised floors, between walls or in any situation where the line is not visible for inspection.  In lieu of daily visual inspections the functionality of the PDS alarm must be tested at least weekly - or as based on guidance in the CNSSI 7003.  Use this set of checks where the unencrypted SIPRNet cable must be installed in a PDS and the site indicates it is an alarmed PDS.  Check to ensure SIPRNet data cables are installed in a carrier properly configured as an ""Alarmed Carrier"" IAW the following guidelines:   1. Ideally the carrier will be constructed of solid electrical metallic tubing (EMT), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid-sheet steel ducting, utilizing elbows, couplings, nipples, and connectors of the same material. Connectors need not be permanently sealed in an alarmed carrier.  As a minimum the carrier may consist of any material equal to or better than standards for a ""Simple PDS"" (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit.  The key to determining the appropriateness of a PDS carrier is its suitability for supporting the functionality of the approved alarm sensor, which provides a means to detect tampering and/or breach of the actual PDS carrier - *not a breach of the space surrounding the carrier. An alarmed carrier must be protected by an alarm system that detects attempted penetration of the carrier. An IDS sensor capable of detecting changes in carrier air pressure is an example of an acceptable detection methodology. (CAT I)  2. As an alternative to an alarmed carrier, the space surrounding the entire carrier may be covered by an area or volumetric (e.g., infrared, motion detection) alarm system.  (CAT I)  3. The carrier and/or volumetric alarm system sensor employed must be approved by the cognizant physical security authorities.  Documentation must exist to support this approval. (CAT II)  4. The alarm system and signal transmission must be part of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) meeting the requirements of the Appendix to Enclosure 3 of DoD Manual 5200.01,V3 (INFOSEC - Protection of Classified Information). For instance: The alarm must provide protection from tampering and be able to register malfunctions. The alarm system must also transmit a line fault message to the annunciator panel if the system fails. (CAT I)  5. The alarm signal must be sent to a 24/7 monitor station that is supervised continuously by U.S. citizens who have been subjected to a trustworthiness determination according to DoD Manual 5200.02 Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP). (CAT I)  6. The monitor station must be capable of notifying security forces that can respond within 15 minutes. (CAT I)  *NOTE: May be reduced to a CAT II severity level finding if the monitor station is capable of notifying security forces but the security forces are not capable of responding within 15 minutes.  7. PDS alarm functionality and performance must be verified on at least a weekly basis IAW Table 5 of the CNSSI 7003. (CAT I)   *NOTE: Alarm functionality tests performed less than weekly, but at least once every 3-months can be reduced to a CAT II severity level finding.  8. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must be available, which is approved by the facility security officer or security manager and commander/director, and the PDS approval authority. (CAT III)    This SOP must include procedures to:  a. Verify the alarm functionality and performance on at least a weekly basis IAW Table 5 of the CNSSI 7003.   b. Ensure response by security personnel in the area of possible attempted penetration, within 15 minutes of discovery;    c. Provide for inspection of the PDS to determine the cause of the alarm;  d. Define action to be taken regarding the termination of transmission;  e. Initiate investigation of actual intrusion attempt, etc.  9. The PDS is not located within an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA) and National Manager (NSA) approved encryption solutions must be employed.  (CAT I) Fix: An Alarmed PDS is one of five types of Category 2 PDS IAW the CNSSI 7003. It is a suitable alternative for the two types of interior PDS, which are Hardened Carrier or Continuously Viewed Carrier. It should be used when the unencrypted data transmission line is concealed above suspended ceilings, below raised floors, between walls or in any situation where the line is not visible for inspection.  In lieu of daily visual inspections the functionality of the PDS alarm must be tested at least weekly - or as based on guidance in the CNSSI 7003.  Ensure unencrypted SIPRNet data cables are installed in a carrier properly configured as an ""Alarmed Carrier"" IAW the following guidelines:   1. Ideally the carrier will be constructed of solid electrical metallic tubing (EMT), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid-sheet steel ducting, utilizing elbows, couplings, nipples, and connectors of the same material. Connectors need not be permanently sealed in an alarmed carrier.  As a minimum the carrier may consist of any material equal to or better than standards for a ""Simple PDS"" (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit.  The key to determining the appropriateness of a PDS carrier is its suitability for supporting the functionality of the approved alarm sensor, which provides a means to detect tampering and/or breach of the actual PDS carrier - *not a breach of the space surrounding the carrier.  An IDS sensor capable of detecting changes in carrier air pressure is an example of an acceptable detection methodology.  2. As an alternative to an alarmed carrier, the space surrounding the entire carrier may be covered by an area or volumetric (e.g., infrared, motion detection) alarm system.   3. The carrier and/or volumetric alarm system sensor employed must be approved by the cognizant physical security authorities.  Documentation must exist to support this approval.   4. The alarm system and signal transmission must be part of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) meeting the requirements of the Appendix to Enclosure 3 of DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 (INFOSEC - Protection of Classified Information). For instance: The alarm must provide protection from tampering and be able to register malfunctions. The alarm system must also transmit a line fault message to the annunciator panel if the system fails.   5. The alarm signal must be sent to a 24/7 monitor station that is supervised continuously by U.S. citizens who have been subjected to a trustworthiness determination according to DoD Manual 5200.02 Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP).   6. The monitor station must be capable of notifying security forces that can respond within 15 minutes.   7. PDS alarm functionality and performance must be verified on at least a weekly basis IAW Table 5 of the CNSSI 7003.   8. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must be available, which is approved by the facility security officer or security manager and commander/director, and the PDS approval authority.    This SOP must include procedures to:  a. Verify the alarm functionality and performance on at least a weekly basis IAW Table 5 of the CNSSI 7003.   b. Ensure response by security personnel in the area of possible attempted penetration, within 15 minutes of discovery;    c. Provide for inspection of the PDS to determine the cause of the alarm;  d. Define action to be taken regarding the termination of transmission;  e. Initiate investigation of actual intrusion attempt, etc.  9. The PDS must not be located within an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA) and National Manager (NSA) approved encryption solutions must be employed."

Such measurements may consist of signal levels, voltage levels, time domain reflectometer (TDR) recorded readings, and any other electrical measurements that may be recorded and retained. * Subsequent technical inspections may then record and compare measurements taken to the previously recorded baseline measurements to identify possible tampering attempts.  4. This check is applicable in a tactical environment if the PDS is located within a fixed facility.  It is not applicable to field/mobile PDS.    5. In the reviewer notes be sure to provide the date of the initial inspection, name of inspector and general description of results.  6. Obviously an initial inspection cannot ever be conducted once it is not completed.  Therefore the fix for this finding is to send a written request to the PDS approval authority asking for an ""initial"" inspection of the PDS by an individual appointed by the approval authority. If the approval authority concurs to conduct the inspection then this finding can be closed once the inspection is actually completed and any results form that inspection are closed.  If the reply from the approval authority indicates they will not complete their ""required"" inspection then then finding can be closed and the reply from the approval authority should be maintained for future reference."

Physically co-locating REL Partners or other FN - who have limited or no access to the SIPRNet or other US Classified systems - near US personnel in a collateral classified (Secret or higher) open storage area or in a Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA) that processes classified material is permissible for operational efficiency and coordination.  Failure to limit and control physical access to information visible on system monitor screens, information processing equipment containing classified data, removable storage media and printed documents is especially important in mixed US/FN environments. Inadequate access and procedural controls can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified materials and data, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information.     Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure the FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them.   The primary control measure is to either keep US Only classified documents, information systems equipment and/ or associated removable storage media under continuous observation and control of a cleared US employee or place such items in an approved safe when unattended.  Additionally, escorting visitors AND all FN employees/personnel into any area where there is US Only classified processing, documents, media, equipment or materials is not only a prudent security measure but an absolute requirement to prevent both intentional (insider threat) or unintentional (inadvertent) unauthorized exposure to classified materials and information.

This is important to note, because without the FN presence in such an environment, placement of classified documents and classified removable media in safes when unattended would not normally be necessary/required.  CHECK #1: Check to ensure all classified and sensitive documents and removable storage media containing US Only information are either under the continuous observation and control of cleared US personnel or placed in an approved GSA container (Safe) when not in use and under proper US control. (CAT I)   The requirement in check #2 is complementary to the requirement covered in check #1. Unescorted access to areas where US Only classified equipment, documents and media are present must not be granted to any FN (regardless of clearance level) when cleared US personnel are not present to provide oversight.   CHECK #2: Check to ensure FN access to classified open storage areas (includes vaults, secure rooms, and SCIFs) containing SIPRNet assets is permitted only during normal working hours when US personnel are present to provide oversight. (CAT I)  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: This check is applicable where REL partners/LN/FN are employed within fixed facilities in a tactical environment with access to US Systems. Fix: This fix pertains to mixed classified environments containing US Only systems and media where FN partners are present:  1. All classified and sensitive documents and removable storage media containing US Only information must either be under the continuous observation and control of cleared US personnel or placed in an approved GSA container (Safe) when not in use and under proper US control.   2.

V-245766,Foreign National (FN) Physical Access Control -  (Identification Badges),low,STIG,"Foreign National (FN) Physical Access Control -  (Identification Badges). Failure to limit access to information visible on system monitor screens in mixed US/FN environments can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified information, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information.  Physically co-locating REL Partners or other FN - who have limited access to the SIPRNet or other US Classified systems - near US personnel in a collateral classified (Secret) open storage area or in a Secret Controlled Access Area (CAA) that processes classified material is permissible for operational efficiency and coordination.  Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure the FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them. Ensuring that US employees can clearly identify FN workers is an important control measure and can be accomplished by requiring the FN employees or partners to wear picture identification badges that clearly identify their affiliated / represented Country.  Wearing of Country specific military uniforms also can be used.

Check: Check there is a written COOP plan for inspected information technology systems:      1. If a COOP or Disaster Recovery Plan is not in place, ensure the AO has considered and accepted the risk (specifically for lack of COOP) from a Holistic Risk Assessment of the organization.     2. Check COOP documentation to ensure the plan is tested at least annually.  Also check for discrepancies noted during the tests and if corrective action has been taken.   3. Conduct a cursory review of the COOP to ensure it is commensurate for COOP of IT systems as detailed within the risk assessment concerning recovery times and testing requirement(s).   NOTES:   1. Certain large computing centers like the DISA Computing Services (DECCs) may offer COOP as a fee for service option. Since this is applicable to ""customer"" applications it should not be a finding attributed to the DECC. If appropriate, COOP or lack thereof if cited as a finding in this instance should be attributed to the specific customer.    2. This requirement should not be applied to a tactical environment, unless it is a fixed computer facility supporting operations within a Theater of Operations.  The standards to be applied for applicability in a tactical environment are:  1) The facility containing the computer room has been in operation over 1-year. 2) The facility is ""fixed facility"" - a hard building made from normal construction materials - wood, steel, brick, stone, mortar, etc. Fix: Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) must be developed and tested for ALL DoDIN connected systems to ensure system and data availability in the event of any type of failure.  If no COOP is in place ensure the risk has been (specifically for lack of a COOP) accepted by the responsible Authorizing Official (AO) in a Holistic Risk Assessment of the organization."

Check: This check is for when a reviewer finds that a COOP process is well established within the inspected organization, but it does not include a minority of systems, requirements, or testing of all systems, for which the risk of having no COOP or testing was not accepted by the Authorizing official (AO) in a holistic risk assessment for the organization.  NOTES:    1. This finding/VUL is only applicable when some of the site/organization systems are connected to the DoDIN and do not have a COOP and/or the COOP is not tested and the risk for not having a COOP and/or documented testing is not accepted by the AO in a holistic risk assessment document.    2. If this finding/VUL is used, IA-02.02.01 is NA.    3. This VUL is applicable in a tactical environment if it involves a fixed facility as previously described.

V-245789,Information Assurance - Network Connections - Wall Jack Security on Classified Networks (SIPRNet or other Inspected Classified Network or System) Where Port Authentication Using IEEE 802.1X IS NOT Implemented,high,STIG,"Information Assurance - Network Connections - Wall Jack Security on Classified Networks (SIPRNet or other Inspected Classified Network or System) Where Port Authentication Using IEEE 802.1X IS NOT Implemented. Following is a summary of the primary requirement to use the IEEE 802.1X authentication protocol to secure SIPRNet ports (AKA: wall jacks) , which is covered in the Network STIG:  802.1X authentication involves three parties: a supplicant, an authenticator, and an authentication server. The supplicant is a client device (such as a laptop) that wishes to attach to the LAN/WLAN. The term 'supplicant' is also used interchangeably to refer to the software running on the client that provides credentials to the authenticator. The authenticator is a network device, such as an Ethernet switch or wireless access point; and the authentication server is typically a host running software supporting the RADIUS and EAP protocols. In some cases, the authentication server software may be running on the authenticator hardware.   The authenticator acts like a security guard to a protected network. The supplicant (i.e., client device) is not allowed access through the authenticator to the protected side of the network until the supplicant's identity has been validated and authorized. With 802.1X port-based authentication, the supplicant provides credentials, such as user name/password or digital certificate, to the authenticator, and the authenticator forwards the credentials to the authentication server for verification. If the authentication server determines the credentials are valid, the supplicant (client device) is allowed to access resources located on the protected side of the network.  The requirements in this Traditional Security STIG rule serve as physical security mitigations for the lack of proper SIPRNet port security using IEEE 802.1X. It is in essence a supplement to the Network STIG and provides the details for required mitigations.   Network connections that are not properly protected are highly vulnerable to unauthorized access, resulting in the loss or compromise of classified or sensitive information.

The wall jacks can:   1. Be located within a Secret or higher vault or Secret or higher secure room (open storage area) or a SCIF.   2. Be under the continuous observation of a cleared individual.   3. Be secured by a Hoffman or similar lock box with a GSA-approved three-position changeable combination padlock. Currently the ONLY lock meeting this standard is the S&G 8077 changeable combination padlock.   *Lock boxes must also have hasps attached in such a way that they cannot be removed without force. Using rivets, welds, etc. is acceptable. Also hinges must not be exposed or be peened or welded in such a manner as to preclude removal without using detectable force. Electrical-type boxes with prepunch holes for conduit or cable cannot be used even if the holes are not removed.   4. Be disabled at the end of each work day. This can ONLY be accomplished by a physical disconnect of the transmission cable at the classified circuit (SIPRNet) Point of Presence (PoP). The PoP must be in an appropriate Secret or higher vault, secure room, or SCIF.   DETAILED EXPLANATION FOLLOWS:  1. The primary and most basic requirement (IAW the Network Policy found in the Layer 2 Switch STIG - Cisco) is implementation of IEEE port authentication standard 802.1X (logical software-based port security) - regardless of the physical area or space in which the wall jacks/ports are located. TRADITIONAL SECURITY REVIEWERS MUST FIRST CHECK WITH THE NETWORK REVIEWER to determine if 802.1X has been properly implemented on SIPRNet before evaluating the physical security of SIPRNet wall jacks. * Do this early in your site visit so that wall jack physical security considerations can be properly evaluated during your site tour/walk around.  2. Not using 802.1X based port authentication on SIPRNet is a CAT I *Network STIG"" finding, separate from any traditional security considerations. However, if 802.1X is not implemented there is another software-based alternative, which is the Network STIG requirement to allow for ""legacy"" port security via MAC address. Several caveats go with this alternative, and this is when the physical security mitigations are required to be implemented:    a. Use of simple port security rather than 802.1X will result in a CAT III (*Network STIG) finding (on NIPRNet or SIPRNet). While this is not a traditional security check, it is something to be aware of.   b. If simple port security rather than 802.1X is implemented *on SIPRNet* (OR IF THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL SOFTWARE-BASED PORT SECURITY), the traditional security considerations and mitigations required IAW the Access Control STIG are as follows:    (1) If the wall jacks/drops/ports are located within spaces properly established as Secret or TS vaults or Secret or TS Secure Rooms (AKA: Collateral Classified Open Storage Areas) OR within an approved SCIF, then there is no requirement for supplemental physical security measures. Again - No supplemental physical security controls are required for SIPRNet wall jacks in these areas.    (2) If the wall jacks are not located in Secret or higher secure room/vault/SCIF, the following physical security controls must be in place:   (a) SIPRNet wall jacks must be secured *when not attended by persons with Secret or higher clearance* by a properly constructed lock box (Hoffman or similar commercial product or locally fabricated). The lock box must be 18-gauge steel or better and have no exposed or removable hinges (internal hinges are ideal). If used, external hinge pins must be peened, welded, etc. so they cannot be removed without evidence of forced removal. Hasp hardware must be riveted to the box or otherwise installed so that removal will require physical breaking of the box or hasp, thereby leaving evidence of actual or attempted entry. No pre-punch (knock-out) holes are allowed in the box. The lock box must be secured with a 3-position high security combination padlock (IAW the CNSSI 7003 standard for PDS ""Pull Boxes""). The S&G 8077 combination padlock is the ONLY existing combo padlock meeting this standard. See the DOD Lock Program site for details:   https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/portal/page/portal/navfac/navfac_ww_pp/navfac_nfesc_pp/locks/CM_LOCKS/CL_PADLOCK/TAB_PADLOCK_PROD   (b) If lock boxes are not used the alternative is to physically disconnect the hot SIPRNet transmission lines at the SIPRNet Point of Presence (PoP) after normal duty hours. The PoP must be located within a proper Secret or higher secure room or vault or SCIF.  NOTE 1: To reiterate the basic requirement: If IEEE 802.1X is properly implemented at the switch to authenticate devices *with clients (such as user work stations)* no additional supplemental physical security controls are required for the wall jacks. VERIFICATION FOR 802.1X IMPLEMENTATION MUST BE COORDINATED WITH THE NETWORK REVIEWER.  NOTE 2: Regardless of Port Authentication using IEEE 802.1X, *clientless devices (such as printers, scanners or multi-functional devices (MFD)* cannot be authenticated - but this should not cause an issue with needing supplemental physical controls (lock box or disconnect at PoP). The reason is because clientless devices like these that are connected to SIPRNet should ""normally"" be maintained in a Secret/TS secure room or vault or SCIF and therefore would not require supplemental physical security of the wall jacks. Otherwise, MFD wall jacks must be protected by lock boxes or physical disconnect at the PoP after normal duty hours. Additional physical security measures or procedures for protection of classified MFD hard drives, residual images and printed materials will also be required, but these considerations are addressed elsewhere on the checklist.   NOTE 3: Do not confuse the STIG wall jack lock box requirement with the CNSSI 7003 lock box requirement on the physical end point (Termination Boxes) of a Protected Distribution System (PDS). The reference for PDS is the CNSSI 7003, not the Access Control STIG. The requirements for PDS (pull-boxes, Access Points or Termination Boxes) and wall jack (lock boxes) are totally separate and unique, although it is possible to find the end of a PDS terminating in a lock box - that ALSO fulfills the requirement for protection of a wall jack where 802.1X is not implemented.   NOTE 4: If there is no ""legacy"" MAC port security in place there will be a CAT I port security finding written by the Network reviewer. If the traditional security reviewer also finds a CAT I finding for lack of physical security protective measures there is a CCRI scoring over ride that will decrease the OVERALL CCRI score. So where there is absolutely no logical or physical port/wall jack security in place - the result is very severe in terms of the CCRI score. Traditional Security reviewers, Network Reviewers (and Team Leads) need to be aware of this because of its significance to the site being reviewed.    NOTE 5: TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT APPLICABILITY: The check is applicable for fixed facility tactical processing environments. Not applicable to a field/mobile environment. Fix: Where port authentication using IEEE 802.1X is not implemented, all SIPRNet wall jacks must be physically secured in the proper manner. The physical security mitigation for Wall Jacks not protected by 802.1X must use one of the following compensatory measures:   1. SIPRNet connected wall jacks must be located within a Secret or higher vault or Secret or higher secure room (open storage area) or a SCIF.   2. SIPRNet connected wall jacks must be under the continuous observation of a cleared individual.   3. SIPRNet connected wall jacks must be secured by a Hoffman or similar lock box with a GSA-approved three-position changeable combination padlock. Currently the ONLY lock meeting this standard is the S&G 8077 changeable combination padlock. Lock boxes must also have hasps attached in such a way as they cannot be removed without force. Using rivets, welds, etc. is acceptable. Also hinges must not be exposed or be peened or welded in such a manner as to preclude removal without using detectable force. Electrical-type boxes with prepunch holes for conduit or cable cannot be used even if the prepunch holes are not removed.   4. SIPRNet connected wall jacks must be disabled at the end of each work day. This can ONLY be accomplished by a physical disconnect of the transmission cable at the classified circuit (SIPRNet) Point of Presence (PoP). The PoP must be located in an appropriate Secret or higher vault, secure room, or SCIF."

All network connections (on NIPRNet or other Unclassified Network under review) such as routers, switches, and hubs must be secured within a locked communications closet/room OR secured within a cabinet if the equipment is located in a room that is accessed by personnel other than designated network system administrators (e.g., SAs specifically designated to administer the network devices) and/or those with security management oversight (e.g., ISSM, ISSO, SM).  2. If other (authorized) personnel (e.g., other than assigned system/network administrators or security management) are permitted to have unimpeded access to network devices, this authorization must be approved in writing by the site commander/director or perhaps other significant staff officer with security oversight of information systems (e.g., J6, ISSM). The documentation must include a justification indicating why the unimpeded/unescorted access is mission essential. This access allowance must be limited to very few personnel and not provided for mere convenience.   3. The locked room or cabinet must be adequately secured so that it cannot be easily accessed without forcible entry.   4. Proper key control procedures must be in place for associated keys used to secure doors to communications rooms AND equipment cabinets.   NOTE: Because locks and keys to equipment cabinets are often inferior and do not provide for adequate physical protection it is recommended that a metal hasp be attached (using rivets or other means that cannot be removed without evidence of forcible entry) to equipment cabinets securing network equipment. General Services Administration (GSA) Medium Security Keyed Padlocks or (preferably) the S&G 8077 Changeable Combination Padlock should then be used to secure the cabinet using the hasp."

Check: 1. Check there are DD Forms 254 available for all classified contracts.   NOTE: These forms may be held by the site contracting officials but should be available to the site security manager and information security manager for review.  2. Conduct a cursory review of the DD 254 to ensure all security requirements are properly detailed on the form, especially with regard to Information Assurance (i.e., IT Position level designation) in addition to security clearance, training and certification requirements.   NOTE: Applicable to tactical environments if there are contractor personnel performing classified work. This form will likely only be found at fixed locations rather than field locations. While the DD 254 may not be available on site or even in Theater, the completed document's location should be identified and if possible a scanned and emailed copy requested for review. This will likely only be able to occur via SIPRNet email because some of these forms contain classified information, while all others are only FOUO. Fix: 1. DD Forms 254 must be on hand for each classified contract.   2.

DOD 5220.22-M (NISPOM), Incorporating Change 2, 18 May 2016, Chapter 6. Check: 1. Check with the security manager or personnel security specialists to ensure there are written procedures for contractors visiting government sites.   2. Ask to see copies of the site VALs and/or determine site VAL process based on the processing of contractors on your inspection team.   3. Ensure all government facilities have a VAL on file for all contractors visiting the site, including permanent party contractors.   NOTES:   1. DISS should and will likely be used for most short-term ""visitor"" VALs; however, in addition to DISS the VAL may also be passed via hard copy or electronically using email (mail, fax, email) for ""assigned"" contractor employees. This is because DISS is by design intended for short-term visits, whereas contractor ""employee"" VALs should require additional information (such as contract number, COR identification, etc.) that cannot be input or passed via DISS. Lack of a hard-copy VAL alone for assigned contractor employees at a site will not necessarily be cause for a finding if a VAL in DISS is available. Reviewers must use discretion when evaluating if the lack of hard-copy VAL has caused any substantive confusion over the company Facility Clearance Level (FCL), individual contract employee security clearance levels, IT position assignments based on job descriptions (found in applicable Statements of Work [SOW] and/or DD 254), etc. when deciding if a finding is warranted. For instance, an individual employee's DISS access might indicate they have TS clearance - but the FCL for the company is only at the Secret level and/or the contract only allows for up to Secret access. If the site is allowing access to TS for this individual, the lack of a hard-copy VAL could be cited as a finding, in addition to any other related findings for this discovery.  2. Applies in a tactical environment if contract personnel visit or are assigned.  3. Reviewers should be sure to note in the findings report if the finding concerns DISS issues for short-term contractor visitors or if it concerns ""hard-copy"" VALs for assigned contractor employees. Fix: 1. Written procedures must be developed that cover the requirements and process for VALs for contractors visiting and/or employed at government sites.   2. All government sites must have a VAL on file for each contractor visiting the site temporarily and also for permanent party contractors routinely working/physically employed at the site.   NOTES:   DISS should be used for most short-term ""visitor"" VALs; however, in addition to DISS (or as an alternative to JPAS for contractors who do not have DISS accounts) VALs may also be passed via hard copy or electronically using email (mail, fax, email) for ""assigned"" contractor employees. This is because DISS is by design intended for short-term visits; whereas, contractor ""employee"" VALs require additional information (such as contract number, COR identification, etc.) that cannot be input or passed via DISS.   A hard-copy VAL for assigned contractor employees will help to eliminate substantive confusion over the company Facility Clearance Level (FCL), individual contract employee security clearance levels, IT position assignments based on job descriptions (found in applicable SOW and/or DD 254), etc."

Information Security Oversight Office, 32 CFR Parts 2001 and 2003 Classified National Security Information; Final Rule: Subpart H - Standard Forms Check: Check all safes, vaults and/or secure rooms (*only those containing DoDIN assets) for proper management practices:  1. Ensure only GSA-approved security containers are being utilized. GSA-approved security containers and vault doors must have a label indicating ""General Services Administration Approved Security Container,"" affixed to the front of the container. Usually this is on the control or the top drawer of safes.  2. Ensure combinations are changed as required. This is recorded on the applicable SF 700 form and must be done: When placed in service, When someone with knowledge of the combination departs (unless other sufficient controls exist to prevent that individual's access to the lock), When compromise of the combination is suspected, or When taken out of service,  built-in combination locks shall be reset to the standard combination of 50-25-50.  3. Ensure forms SF 700, Security Container Information are properly completed for each safe, vault and secure room used to store classified DISN assets. The SF 700 is a two-part form consisting of an envelope with a tear-off tab and cover sheet. The cover sheet and face of the envelope (Part 1 of the form) provide space for information about the activity, container, type of lock, and who to contact if the container is left open. Required checks follow. Ensure the SF 700:     a. Shows the location of the door or container.    b. Reflects the names, home addresses, and home telephone numbers of the individuals having knowledge of the combination who are to be contacted in the event that the vault, secure room, or container is found open and unattended.    c. Part 1 of SF 700 is not classified, but contains personally identifiable information (PII) that shall be protected by sealing Part 1 in an opaque envelope (not provided as part of the SF 700) conspicuously marked ""Security Container Information"" and stored in accordance with SF 700 instructions. NOTE: If the information must be accessed during non-duty hours and a new opaque envelope is not available to replace the opened one, the original envelope should be temporarily resealed, to the extent possible, until Part 1 can be placed in a new envelope the next working day.    d. After the cover sheet (Part 1) is filled out and sealed in an opaque envelope, attach it to the inside of the control drawer or on the inside face of the vault or secure room door, with either tape or a magnetically-attached holder.    e. The tear-off tab (Part 2) with the combination record is placed in the envelope provided with the form, sealed, properly marked with the classification level and stored by the security manager in another approved classified container.  4. Ensure forms SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet are properly completed for each safe, vault and secure room used to store classified DISN assets. Following are required checks for the SF 702 form. Ensure:     a. It provides a record of the names and times that persons have opened, closed or checked a particular container (safe, vault or secure room) that holds classified information.    b. It is properly annotated to reflect each opening and closing of the container.    c. It is properly annotated to reflect (at least) daily checks of ALL containers - whenever an area housing the containers is entered/occupied - EVEN IF THE CONTAINER IS NOT OPENED. If on weekends or holidays the area housing the container is not occupied the SF 702 would not require annotation; however, in the event the area is accessed for even a short period of time, the SF 702 forms for each container in the area should be annotated to reflect the container was checked. Annotation of the SF 702 forms should be conducted IN ADDITION TO the annotation of SF 701 forms reflecting end-of-day checks.  NOTE: If CC/S/A INFOSEC implementing instructions contain specific guidance in contradiction to the above DoDIN SF 702 requirements/checks then the CC/S/A guidance may be followed. Failure to comply with either the above guidance or CC/S/A documented guidance will result in a finding of non-compliance.  5. Ensure container repairs are conducted correctly IAW FED-STD-809.

Check: For secure rooms or areas (*containing inspectable SIPRNet assets) check windows as follows:   1. Window placement in secure rooms should be minimal.  Ideally, there should be no large or entirely glass walls; although this will not automatically result in a finding if the glass is hardened to the same degree as the contiguous walls and properly obscured from outside viewing. Where windows are located on the exterior of secure rooms (AKA: collateral classified open storage areas) the vulnerabilities, existing and potential additional countermeasures, and residual risk associated with the windows must be considered in an assessment of risk for the secure room.

Windows that are less than 18 feet above the ground measured from the bottom of the window, or are easily accessible by means of objects directly beneath the windows shall be constructed from or covered with materials that provide protection from forced entry. The protection provided to the windows need be no stronger than the strength of the contiguous walls.  Hurricane rated windows, ballistic proof windows, non-opening double or triple pane windows, etc. should be considered acceptable as equivalent to contiguous walls.  Welded steel bars attached to the structure surrounding the window may also be used for hardening windows that are not as strong as the contiguous walls (e.g. single pane glass).    3.

Failure to meet standards for maintenance and validation of structural integrity of the physical perimeter surrounding a secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3, could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.  Using a physical intrusion detection system enables immediate detection of attempted and/or actual intrusion into a secure room space.  This is often the best supplemental protective measure (vice using 4-hour random checks) due to providing capability for immediate detection, and for immediate response to assess and counter the threat to the secure room space.  Use of 4-hour checks may be adequate if supported by a risk assessment, but will not provide the immediate detection and response capability of a properly installed IDS.

Failure to meet standards for ensuring that there is structural integrity of the physical perimeter surrounding a secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3 could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.  When a physical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used as the supplemental protection measure (in lieu of 4-hour random checks) for secure rooms there is a requirement to place a Balanced Magnetic Switch (BMS) alarm contact on the primary ingress/egress door and any secondary/emergency exit doors.  This alarm sensor is an essential part of any properly installed IDS and ensures that doors opened by force or that are left open are immediately detected.  A BMS (AKA: triple biased alarm contact) is the most difficult door alarm contact to defeat and must be used in lieu of dual biased or simple alarm contacts.

V-245803,Information Security (INFOSEC) - Secure Room Storage Standards - Interior Motion Detection,high,STIG,"Information Security (INFOSEC) - Secure Room Storage Standards - Interior Motion Detection. Failure to meet standards for ensuring that there is structural integrity of the physical perimeter surrounding a secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3 could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.  Motion detection located interior to secure rooms provides the most complete/overarching coverage of any Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensor.  While most sensors like BMS alarm contacts, glass break detectors, etc. are only able to detect potential intrusion at specific locations, use of motion detection provides a capability to protect large areas with ""blanket coverage"" generally using fewer sensors.  Principles and considerations for ""ideal"" employment of motion sensors are:  - Consolidate critical assets in specific areas versus throughout a large room or facility. For instance rather than having classified servers and equipment in multiple locations in a five-story facility (entirely designated for classified open storage) consolidate classified assets on a single floor or even an area on that floor. That might allow for reducing the space designated as classified open storage (AKA: secure room) and reduce costs and simplify protection of assets.    - Conversely some would argue that dispersing assets over a larger area enhances security by not putting all critical assets in one place. This is true to an extent - especially if we are considering redundant assets for COOP / disaster recovery but most often the reason for dispersing classified assets over large comes down to lack of foresight and planning.  - Cover avenues of approach in layers so you can detect initial breeches of secured space and subsequent movement within. This approach is actually very good if you have a timely response force available and you are protecting a large facility.  - Cover perimeter access points such as doors, windows, and openings greater than 96 sq. inches. Use of point sensors (BMS, vibration, etc., are probably best in these situations but supplementation by motion can be extremely effective.  - Cover areas that cannot be directly observed by employees from within or directly outside the protected space. For instance in a secure room/area this might include areas above suspended ceilings, below raised floors, behind major pieces of equipment or other things that cause significant obstruction of visual observation (especially along avenues of approach or along perimeter walls).  - Cover large open areas by careful placement of motion detection. Combinations of 360-degree and wall-mounted detectors considering equipment racks, walls, avenues of approach, etc. can effectively cover larger areas with fewer sensors.  - Complete coverage of large areas and all avenues of approach is ideal but often funds are limited and sensors cannot be employed to provide blanket coverage. In such instances there are two approaches that can be used:     * One is to cover the most critical assets directly (e.g., classified DoDIN servers, routers, DASD and other major IT technology).     * Second approach is to conduct an assessment of the space to determine the most effective employment of limited sensors considering both avenues of approach and the actual location of critical assets in the space.     NOTE:  The second approach can be incorporated under the process of conducting a risk assessment and in conjunction with a determination and approval of security-in-depth countermeasures from the Senior Agency Official (SAO). This risk-based approach is based directly on requirements from the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and is in line with the current direction DoD is taking with regard to management of risk.

Check at sites where IDS is being used and:      -  There is NO RISK ASSESSMENT approved by the Component Authorizing Official (AO) or      -  The risk assessment does not specifically provide a detailed evaluation of the need for motion sensor employment, including a thorough assessment of the most effective and efficient methods for employment of motion detection and/or      -  There is NO SECURITY-IN-DEPTH DETERMINATION *IN WRITING by the CC/S/A Senior Agency Official (SAO)(Security/INFOSEC) that considers factors contained in the risk assessment and specifically focuses on the collateral classified secure room/open storage space:  Check to ensure that secure rooms or areas where classified SIPRNet equipment and/or associated media is stored in the open is protected with interior motion detection sensors; e.g., ultrasonic and passive infrared, during times when the specific area containing the classified material is closed or not under continuous observation and control by a cleared employee.   Use of dual technology sensors is authorized when one technology transmits an alarm condition independently from the other technology.  A failed detector shall cause an immediate and continuous alarm condition.    Employment of motion detectors need not cover 100% of the entire secure room space (although that is recommended) but shall minimally (directly) cover any SIPRNet assets (equipment or media) that are accessible (not stored within a GSA approved container (safe)) within the secure room or area.  2. Where a proper risk assessment signed by the AO, which specifically considers both the number and employment (positioning) of motion sensors in the secure room space and a supporting Security-in-Depth Determination signed by the SAO are both available:  Check that motion sensors are either employed to directly cover all areas within the secure room containing SIPRNet assets OR that motion sensors are employed in the secure room space as specifically detailed in the risk assessment.  NOTE:  Unless adequately detailed and justified in the risk assessment, motion detectors placed to cover only doors that are protected with BMS alarm contacts are not sufficient to meet this requirement/check.    TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable where Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment.

Using a physical intrusion detection system enables immediate detection of attempted and/or actual intrusion into a secure room space.

It is required that a risk assessment be conducted to determine which of the two intrusion detection methods (use of IDS OR 4-hour random checks) is appropriate for any particular location.  If the risk assessment results in a determination that use of 4-hour random checks is the most cost efficient supplemental control (vice IDS) to protect SIPRNet assets contained in secure rooms, the manner in which the checks are conducted can greatly impact the effectiveness of the checks.

(*for risk assessment requirements) Check: Background:  This check is concerned with using random checks as the required supplemental control of secure room/collateral classified open storage area space (containing SIPRNet assets) - instead of IDS.    Checks:  Check #1. Use of random checks in lieu of IDS must be supported by a valid risk assessment (addressing each secure room or area) that specifically considers the threat, vulnerabilities, security-in-depth countermeasures, acceptability of risk, potential cost savings, procedural requirements, and potential cost of additional manpower associated with random checks of the secure areas - as an alternative to IDS.    Check #2. The frequency of random checks shall not exceed 4-hours when the secure area space is not attended.   Check #3. Checks must be conducted by guards/employees who are cleared to at least the Secret level.    Check #4.  Checks will be conducted of each door (primary and all secondary), each window, and each opening exceeding 96 square inches (which are required to be protected with either bars, expanded metal grills, commercial metal sounds baffles) to ensure they are properly secured.  Additionally all traversable space surrounding the exterior of the Secure Room should be viewed by the checker by walking around the entire perimeter.    Check #5.  Checks must be supported by written procedures/instructions for the checkers and results of checks must be recorded.    Check #6. Locally developed checklists or the Standard Form (SF) 701 must be used to document checks.  Completed checklists should be maintained on-hand for at least 90-days as an audit trail or indefinitely if discrepancies were noted during any checks.  It is important to note that random checks are an allowable alternative to IDS *ONLY* if supported by a valid risk assessment AND security-in-depth countermeasures as determined in writing by the C/S/A senior security official.  Otherwise this is a finding.    Use of IDS and risk analysis are each covered as separate checks elsewhere in this document.     This particular check (random checks of secure rooms) is Not Applicable (NA) if IDS is used.    In summary this check must validate that random checks not exceeding 4-hours are being used AND that it is supported by a valid risk assessment along with security-in-depth countermeasures.                              TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable where Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment. The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used. Fix: Background:  This requirement is concerned with using random checks as the required supplemental control of secure room/collateral classified open storage area space (containing SIPRNet assets) - instead of IDS.    Fixes:  1. Use of random checks in lieu of IDS must be supported by a valid risk assessment (addressing each secure room or area) that specifically considers the threat, vulnerabilities, security-in-depth countermeasures, acceptability of risk, potential cost savings, procedural requirements, and potential cost of additional manpower associated with random checks of the secure areas - as an alternative to IDS.    2. The frequency of random checks must not exceed 4-hours when the secure area space is not attended.   3. Checks must be conducted by guards/employees who are cleared to at least the Secret level.    4. Checks must be conducted of each door (primary and all secondary), each window, and each opening exceeding 96 square inches (which are required to be protected with either bars, expanded metal grills, commercial metal sounds baffles) to ensure they are properly secured.  Additionally all traversable space surrounding the exterior of the Secure Room must be viewed by the checker by walking around the entire perimeter.    5.  Checks must be supported by written procedures/instructions for the checkers and results of checks must be recorded.    6. Locally developed checklists or the Standard Form (SF) 701 must be used to document checks.  Completed checklists should be maintained on-hand for at least 90-days as an audit trail or indefinitely if discrepancies were noted during any checks.  It is important to note that random checks are an allowable alternative to IDS *ONLY* if supported by a valid risk assessment AND security-in-depth countermeasures as determined in writing by the CC/S/A senior agency official (SAO)(INFOSEC).  Not meeting this requirement will result in a finding.    Use of IDS and risk analysis are each covered as separate checks elsewhere in this document.     This particular requirement (random checks of secure rooms) is Not Applicable (NA) if IDS is used.    In summary this requirement is intended to implement and validate that random checks not exceeding 4-hours are being used AND that it is supported by a valid risk assessment along with security-in-depth countermeasures."

V-245807,Information Security (IS) - Continuous Operations Facility: Access Control Monitoring Methods,high,STIG,"Information Security (IS) - Continuous Operations Facility: Access Control Monitoring Methods. Failure to control door access to a Continuous Operations Facility containing classified SIPRNET assets may result in immediate and potentially undetected access to classified information, with no capability to immediately alert response forces.  Ultimately this could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.  USE CASE EXPLANATION:  A Continuous Operations Facility functions 24/7 and contains classified SIPRNet equipment and/or media.  It often does not meet all the physical and/or procedural requirements of a vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) and the classified equipment and/or media may not be stored in an approved safe when not in use.  Examples of such facilities are Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Information System Monitoring Centers, Trouble Desk Centers, etc.  All standards for access control monitoring for Continuous Operations Facilities are found in the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and this STIG Requirement/Rule provides additional clarification and implementation standards for all Continuous Operations Facilities containing SIPRNet assets.  Continuous Operations Facilities are not routinely closed and secured after normal business hours and reopened at the beginning of normal workdays.   A CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS FACILITY MUST BE CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPIED at all times, OR IT MUST MEET ALL PHYSICAL STRUCTURAL AND PROCEDURAL STANDARDS FOR A SECURE ROOM AND BE SECURED (*using an approved FF-L-2740 combination lock) DURING PERIODS WHEN IT IS NOT OCCUPIED.  It is not necessary to activate the supplemental controls (IDS or 4-hour checks) when securing the facility using the FF-L-2740 lock during working hours. However, this must be done if the facility is formally closed at any time and will include End-of-Day (EOD) checks.   A ""facility"" can be a single room or a larger contiguous area, often (but not always) without Federal Specification FF-L-2740 combination locks on the primary access door.  Continuous Operations area access control procedures must meet the requirements herein even where the surrounding area is continuously occupied.  Continuous Operations (again - continuous occupancy)  minimizes or eliminates the need for/use of certain security measures such as FF-L-2740 combination locks, standard door locks, IDS, 4-hour guard checks, etc.  Where there is a Continuous Operations Facility there should be demonstrated mission need for continuous occupation of the ""specific"" room or area containing the classified SIPRNet assets.  A justification that the surrounding building or facility is continuously occupied is not acceptable.  If this is observed, reviewers should consider the possibility that the stated requirement for a Continuous Operations Facility is being used to cover deficiencies with what should legitimately be established as a secure room or vault.  In such cases the use of Traditional Security STIG Requirements and applicable physical and procedural standards for vaults and/or secure rooms may be more appropriate, resulting in findings under those Requirements.  A Continuous Operations Facility containing classified materials is most appropriate when it is continuously occupied by properly cleared employees (or others with security clearance and a need-to-know) who are capable of controlling or monitoring ingress and egress from within the area.  This provides the most legitimate justification for using a Continuous Operations Facility vice using a properly constructed and access controlled vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area).  Convenience and ease of access is not proper justification for a Continuous Operations Facility.  Continuous Operations Facility door control may be accomplished multiple ways.  There are five main types of access control methods listed below.  One or more of the five methods may apply to any facility.  Each access point must comply with one or more of the methods of access control for 24 hours of each operational day.  Any deficiency for any facility access point (even for a portion of the day for an access point) will result in a finding under this STIG rule.  All Continuous Operations Facilities access points should be checked for proper access control according to the type of access control method(s) implemented.  Direct access control monitoring for both occupied and unoccupied Continuous Operations Facilities is conducted by:  cleared employees, guards or receptionists located inside the area or directly outside the area.  A properly configured Automated Entry Control System (AECS) or continuously monitored Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) are the only options for indirect monitoring of Continuous Operations Facilities.  The five basic methods for controlling access to Continuous Operations Facilities are:  1.  Method #1: Use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) Card Reader with Biometrics or Personal Identification Number (PIN)  2.  Method #2:  Access Continually Monitored by Occupants (Cleared Employees) of the Continuous Operations Facility - all doors NOT visible  3.  Method #3:  Access Monitored by Occupants (Cleared Employees) of the Continuous Operations Facility - all doors are visible  4.  Method #4:  Access Monitored by Employees Directly Outside the Open Storage Space - all doors MUST BE visible  5.  Method #5:  Access Monitored by Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) reporting to a Central Monitoring Station Staffed 24/7 by cleared Guards or Other cleared Security Professionals - each individual door MUST HAVE a CCTV camera(s)  Normally only one method of access control will be applicable to a specific Continuous Operations Facility; however, there may be situations where more than one approved method is being used at a single facility.  For instance an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) with card reader and PIN may be used to secure the access door while there are also employees located inside the room who can monitor and control access.  In situations where multiple methods are found, reviewers need only choose one of the five to evaluate compliance and its effectiveness of access control to the Continuous Operations Facility.  If one of the methods is found to be totally compliant while others in use contain deficiencies, the method that is 100% compliant should be selected for use during the review.  In the example just provided, if the room is only occupied by one employee who is monitoring access and during breaks or for other reasons exits the room for periods of time this would cause a significant deficient condition since the access door is not continuously monitored by the employee.  Therefore using the AECS as the method to evaluate access control for the Continuous Operations Facility would likely be selected since it appears to be (and for this example we will assume) 100% compliant.  There is also a possibility that multiple Continuous Operations Facilities could be found at a particular site location (even in the same building) that are using different methods to control access.  Once again, multiple methods of access control from the list of five could be selected for the evaluation, based on the access control methods actually being used for the various 24/7Continuous Operations Facilities.  Once the applicable Continuous Operations Facility access control methods that apply to each of the Continuous Operations Facilities at the site are selected, the site must comply with all of the individual checks for the selected method(s).  Specific checks for requirements associated with a method of access control are found in the Check Content information field.  If there is no Continuous Operations Facility at a particular site this Requirement is Not Applicable (NA) for a review.

Failure to properly monitor and control collateral classified open storage area access doors during working hours (while the FF-L-2740 combination lock is not secured)  could result in an undetected perimeter breach and limited or no capability to immediately notify response forces.  Ultimately this could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.  Entrances to secure rooms or areas (and/or vaults that are opened for access) must be under visual control at all times during duty hours to prevent entry by unauthorized personnel . This may be accomplished by several methods (e.g., employee work station, guard, continuously monitored CCTV).   An automated entry control system (AECS) may be used to control admittance during working hours instead of visual control, if it meets certain criteria * and if the room or area is continuously occupied by at least one properly cleared person.

An automated access control system (AECS) may be used to monitor and control admittance during working hours instead of visual control, if it consists of a swipe or proximity coded card and reader, supplemented by the use of a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or by use of Biometric readers (fingerprints, retina scanner, etc.).   Additionally, the secure room or classified storage area must be occupied by cleared employees OR under direct visual control from just outside the room or area.  Use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) alone may not be used to meet this standard.  Use of an AECS to control and monitor access requires the room or area be occupied by at least one properly cleared person.  4.  Visual monitoring or control of secure room access points may be accomplished by several methods (e.g., employee work station, guard, ""continuously monitored"" CCTV).  Employee monitoring may be conducted by cleared employees within the secure room space, who can observe all entrances or employees located just outside the secure room adjacent to an entrance may also ""actively"" monitor access. If CCTV is used to monitor, the CCTV cameras must cover all potential entrances and send real time images back to a continuously manned monitoring station.  5.  Regardless of the visual method used to monitor daytime access, a locking system for access control must still be used on the entrance to the secure area.  The use of automated entry control systems,(AECS with coded ID cards or badges) is encouraged.  Supplementing the coded (swipe or proximity) cards or badges with a PIN or biometrics is not required if the entrances are properly monitored by visual means.    6.  Access to secure areas may also be controlled by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours, but only if the entrance is also under continuous visual control.   7.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Electrically actuated locks (e.g., cypher, proximity card and magnetic strip card locks) do not afford by themselves the required degree of protection for classified information and must not be used as a substitute for the combination locks meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740.   CHECKS:  *If f visual control methods are the primary means to monitor and control access during duty hours, use the following three checks to evaluate:   Check #1.  Check to ensure that all possible primary or secondary entrances to vaults or secure rooms are continuously monitored by cleared employees or guards (inside or outside the room or area) or by CCTV, whenever the FF-L-2740 combination lock is disengaged for daytime or other routine access.     (CAT I)  Check #2.  Check to ensure that if CCTV is used it sends real time images to a continuously manned monitoring station.  (CAT I)  Check #3.  If CCTV is used to visually monitor the secure room or area and / or guards or other personnel are not physically controlling access: Check to ensure that access to a continuously (visually) monitored vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area is controlled either by an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) using coded cards or badges (biometrics or PIN are not required) or by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours.  (CAT I)  NOTE: Electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices may not be used to control access when the entrance(s) to the vault, secure room or area are not under continuous visual monitoring either directly by cleared employees at the entrance(s) or via CCTV.  If using CCTV it must also be continuously monitored and recorded at an occupied monitoring station.  **If an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) is used to control access (without use of any authorized visual control methods), use the following seven checks to evaluate:  CHECKS:  Check #1. Check to ensure the vault, secure room or area is continuously occupied by at least one properly cleared employee during working hours (when the FF-L-2740 combination lock is not engaged. (CAT I)  Check #2. Check to ensure the AECS identifies individuals and authenticates the person's authority to enter the area through the use of a coded identification (ID) badge or card. (CAT I)  Check #3. Check to ensure that in addition to the swipe or proximity card or badge - that a personal identification number (PIN) is used.  This is required WHEN VISUAL (MONITORING) of the entrance IS NOT USED during working hours. (CAT II - when an AECS card and reader is used w/o PIN or biometrics)   Check #4. Check the PINs are separately entered into the system by each individual using a keypad device and consist of four or more digits, randomly selected, with no known or logical association with the individuals. (CAT II -only  when an AECS with card and PIN is used)   Check #5. Check to ensure there is a procedure to cover changing PINs when it is believed they have been compromised or subjected to compromise. (CAT III)   Check #6. Biometrics Devices, which identify an individual requesting access by some unique personal characteristic, such as Fingerprinting, Hand Geometry, Handwriting, Retina scans, or Voice recognition may be used in conjunction with an ID badge or card in lieu of a PIN.  (CAT II - when an AECS card and reader is used w/o PIN or biometrics)  Check #7.  VERY IMPORTANT: Check to ensure that electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices such as Cipher locks ARE NOT USED to control access to vaults, secure rooms or areas when entrances  are not under continuous visual control during working hours.  Generally these locks do not provide the means for individual access codes and do not report to a central server or system monitor.  Therefore they are permissible ONLY for access control to vault, secure rooms and spaces when the entrance is under continuous visual control.  (CAT I)  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  These checks are applicable where Vaults/Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment. The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used. Fix: *If use of visual control methods is the primary means to control access during duty hours, use the following three fixes to comply with requirements:  1.  All possible primary or secondary entrances to vaults or secure rooms must be continuously monitored by cleared employees or guards (inside or outside the room or area) or by CCTV, whenever the FF-L-2740 combination lock is disengaged for daytime or other routine access.       2.  If CCTV is used it must send real time images to a continuously manned monitoring station.    3. Access to a continuously (visually) monitored vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area must be controlled by an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) using coded cards or badges (biometrics or PIN are not required) or by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours.   **If use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) is used to control access (without use of any authorized visual control methods), use the following seven fixes to comply with requirements:  1.  The vault, secure room or area must be continuously occupied by at least one properly cleared employee during working hours (when the FF-L-2740 combination lock is not engaged).  2. The AECS must identify individuals and authenticate the person's authority to enter the area through the use of a coded identification (ID) badge or card.   3. In addition to the swipe or proximity card or badge a personal identification number (PIN) must be used.  This is required WHEN VISUAL (MONITORING) CONTROLS of the entrance ARE NOT USED during working hours.    4. The PINs must be separately entered into the system by each individual using a keypad device and consist of four or more digits, randomly selected, with no known or logical association with the individuals.    5. There must be a procedure in place to cover changing PINs when it is believed they have been compromised or subjected to compromise.    6. Biometrics Devices, which identify an individual requesting access by some unique personal characteristic, such as Fingerprinting, Hand Geometry, Handwriting, Retina scans, or Voice recognition may be used in conjunction with an ID badge or card in lieu of a PIN.    7.  VERY IMPORTANT: Electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices such as Cipher locks MUST NOT BE USED to control access to secure rooms or areas that are not under continuous visual control during working hours.

Physical and Environmental Protection. Check: BACKGROUND: In spite of all physical security defensive devices deployed, the possibility of an intrusion always exists. The highest fence can be scaled, the densest wall can be breached, and the stoutest lock can be compromised. Even highly sophisticated alarm systems can be contravened by a knowledgeable professional. It is therefore necessary to institute a system of checks to physically inspect secure room perimeters to check for signs of attempted intrusions and ensure that structural integrity of the perimeter is maintained.   This requirement is concerned with ensuring there is periodic visual validation of structural integrity of secure room/collateral classified open storage area perimeters containing SIPRNet assets and associated media. It ensures that any breach or attempted breach of the walls, true floors, and true ceilings of a secure area (portions that are not readily visible) are discovered in a timely manner.   In Check #1 there are three different situations covered and each requires a different inspection frequency for physical/visual validation of structural integrity.    Check #1. Check to ensure that structural integrity of secure rooms or spaces containing SIPRNet equipment is validated as follows:    Situation #1 (No structural integrity checks required): If interior IDS (motion detection) is properly employed (i.e., directly covering all SIPRNet assets) within the secure room or collateral classified open storage space where classified SIPRNet assets are located AND under raised floor spaces (if applicable) AND above suspended ceiling spaces (if applicable), then no physical check for structural integrity is required. This is contingent upon the interior motion sensors being activated when the room is closed or unattended and the sensors working properly as determined by required checks of sensor functionality.   Situation #2 (Checks required IAW approved written guidance from AO): If motion sensors are properly employed ONLY within the secure room space where classified assets are located, then a visual check of spaces below raised floors, above suspended ceilings, and anywhere else the perimeter of the secure area cannot be readily observed must be conducted IAW AO written guidance. The goal is to visually inspect all walls, true floor, and true ceiling perimeters for signs of breach or attempted breach.   Situation #3 (Checks required IAW written guidance from AO): When random checks (not exceeding four hours) of secure rooms or open storage spaces are used in lieu of IDS, then the checks specified in situation #2 for above suspended ceilings and below raised floors must be conducted IAW AO written guidance. The increased frequency of checks is due to the significant vulnerability of the SIPRNet assets to undetected attack from portions of the perimeter that cannot be readily observed. NOTE: Physical inspection of the perimeter walls, floor, and ceiling can be greatly expedited and may be conducted without ladders or other equipment where there are no false/suspended ceilings and/or raised floors within or surrounding the secure room or area.   NOTE: If the entire perimeter of the secure room or area containing SIPRNet assets is surrounded by a secret or top secret (TS) Controlled Access Area (CAA), the frequency of structural integrity checks may be reduced to once every two weeks. This is due to the increased security-in-depth provided by the CAA. A secret or TS CAA is an area where unescorted access is granted only to individuals who have a secret or higher security clearance. All others are escorted by cleared employees. The DOD does not provide specific physical security requirements for a CAA but allows each CC/S/A Senior Agency Official (SAO) for Information Security the authority to establish such standards. All the Services have established standards for CAAs within their Protected Distribution System (PDS) implementing guidelines. Minimally, all require some form of access control methodology (AECS/guards/reception, etc.) be in place to ensure only properly vetted and cleared personnel have unescorted access to a CAA.  Check #2. Check to ensure there are written procedures developed for the checks and that the checks are documented and maintained on file for a minimum of 90 days. Where discrepancies (holes in perimeter or other signs of successful or attempted access) are noted, these checks will be maintained indefinitely or until an inquiry determines the cause of the discrepancy.    TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: This check is applicable where secure rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment. The only exception will be for urgent (short-term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.

CHECKS: Check to ensure that all keypad devices are properly shielded and/or that persons using these devices have been advised by site security and are aware of the risk of having someone in the vicinity view their PIN as it is entered and that they are exercising due care to shield entry of their PIN.   Verification of employee awareness can be obtained by observing SOPs or employee training records reflecting a warning or requirement to shield entry of PINs.    TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable where Vaults/Secure Rooms are used to protect classified materials or systems in a tactical environment. The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used. Fix: Ensure that keypad devices (cipher locks or PIN pads for card readers) are designed or installed in such a manner that an unauthorized person in the immediate vicinity cannot observe the selection of input numbers. During initial, annual refresher training and when key cards with PINs are issued advise persons using the keypad devices of the risk of someone overseeing their PIN and encourage them to use appropriate caution to shield their selection of numbers."

In a classified operating environment, all unclassified items must be marked in addition to all classified items. For instance, in areas where any classified equipment such as servers, client workstations, printers, routers, crypto, etc. are being used, all classified equipment, media, and documents must be properly marked with classification levels and handling caveats. All unclassified equipment (servers, client workstations, printers, routers, crypto, etc.), media, and documents must also be properly marked as unclassified and with handling caveats, such as CUI, when appropriate. This total marking of all assets in a classified environment eliminates the assumption that anything not marked is unclassified. Hence, all equipment, media, and documents within SCIFs, Vaults, Secure Rooms and classified Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) must be marked with classification levels and handling caveats.  SPECIAL NOTE FOR MONITORS:  Monitors connected to SIPRNet/NIPRNet are inert items of equipment in that they do not store or retain classified data. As long as the monitor border displays the classification level alerting personnel using the system of the protection requirements there is no need to place a classification sticker on the monitor.             If a classification banner is displayed on an active monitor screen then the physical monitor is not required to have a SF-710 (unclassified) or SF-707 (secret) sticker.  Typically, most monitor screens connected to the DISN do have classification banners displayed, so placement of SF stickers on monitors is not an issue.  Also, consider that many workstations are using KVM switches to share monitor screens between NIPRNet and SIPRNet. Hence, the single monitor will be unclassified or classified depending on the network it is connected to at a particular moment, making placement of physical classification labels impractical.                           TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: This check is applicable in a tactical environment if classified documents or media are created or extracted from the SIPRNet. The only exception will be for urgent (short-term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used. All deployed SIPRNet equipment should already contain applicable classification markings/labels. Fix: Ensure all equipment, media, and documents in the areas housing SIPRNet assets contain proper classification markings. In a classified operating environment, all unclassified items must be marked in addition to all classified items. For instance, in areas where any classified equipment such as servers, client workstations, printers, routers, crypto, etc. are being used, all classified equipment, media, and documents must be properly marked with classification levels and handling caveats.

(CAT I)  2. Check to ensure that site security personnel develop written procedures for response to incidents of classified materials found not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee and make the procedures readily available to each employee via electronic means, such as in space on an organizational intranet, shared folders or other means available. (CAT III)  Procedures for response to classified materials discovered that are not in proper storage or under proper control of a cleared person must include the following:    a.  Site security personnel, security reviewers/inspectors, employees or anyone making discovery of classified material not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee immediately take control and properly secure the classified materials not under proper control when not in approved storage.  Second they must report the discovery to their supervisory chain and/or site security officials.  (CAT III)    b.  Site security personnel must initiate a preliminary inquiry if appropriate to determine the cause of the improperly secure material and to determine if any material was lost or compromised (security incident).  (CAT III)    c.

(CAT II)  Suggested methodology for reviewers: During the review/walk-around be observant for classified materials (documents media, and equipment) that have been removed from approved storage.  Specifically look to determine if employees are maintaining positive control of the material.  Unless a properly cleared employee is able to clearly see and control the material - this will be a finding.  The employee(s) must be specifically aware the classified material is in their area AND that they are responsible for ensuring it is controlled/protected.  Just having cleared employee(s) ""in the area"" of the classified material or assuming other cleared employees in the area are responsible for the classified material is not sufficient control.  An example of a possible finding is when someone working on a classified system departs their work space (cube environment) for lunch or other type of break and does not ask another cleared employee to take control of their classified equipment, documents or media OR does not place the classified hard drive, classified documents and classified media in approved storage.  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable in a tactical environment.  The only exception will be where there is a lack of permanent storage solutions for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations.  Primarily this involves field/mobile environments where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.  However, all classified equipment, documents or media not properly stored in a safe, vault or secure room must still be under the continuous observation and control of an appropriately cleared person. Fix: Primary Requirements for Control of Classified Material: Classified documents, information system (IS) equipment and removable media must be:  1. Under the direct personal control and observation of an authorized person, who possesses a security clearance and need-to know equal to or greater than the classified information or material being controlled.  The properly cleared employee(s) must be able to clearly see and control the classified material.  The employee(s) must be specifically aware the classified material is in their area AND that they are responsible for ensuring it is protected.  or  2.  Guarded by a trained professional security official who possesses a security clearance equal to or greater than the classified information or material being controlled.   or  3. Stored in a locked security container (GSA approved safe), vault, secure room, collateral classified open storage area or SCIF with protection equal to or exceeding the highest classification of the material/equipment.   Secondary Requirements:  Actions to enhance protection of classified materials:  1.  Site security personnel must conduct initial and annual training to indoctrinate and remind employees of procedures and requirements to maintain positive control of classified materials removed from approved storage.   2.  Site security personnel must develop written procedures for protection and storage of classified materials and make the procedures readily available to each employee via electronic means, such as in space on an organizational intranet, shared folders or other means available.    3. Site security personnel must conduct regular checks of their areas of responsibility and constantly be observant to ensure that classified materials (documents media, and equipment) that have been removed from approved storage are under the continuous personal observation and control of cleared persons.    Tertiary Requirements:  Required Actions upon discovery of classified material not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee:  1.  Site security personnel, security reviewers/inspectors, employees or anyone making discovery of classified material not in secure storage or under continuous observation and control of a cleared employee must immediately take control and properly secure any classified materials not under proper control when not in approved storage.  Second they must report the discovery to their supervisory chain and/or site security officials.    2.

Paper copies of the signed NDA will likely not be available in a tactical area of operations; however, system access to DISS should be possible if the theater of operations has been well established. Fix: All assigned personnel granted access to classified information must have a signed NDA on record. The execution of an NDA must be annotated in the DISS and a signed hard copy MAY also be available locally.   Personnel who transfer from other units or organizations will not necessarily have a signed hard-copy NDA on file locally since they are only required to sign the NDA once, but it MUST be reflected in DISS.

Check: BACKGROUND NOTE:  This requirement includes both situations where there is primarily a US Classified processing environment (no routine Foreign National (FN) presence) AND also contains guidance to be used for environments where FN are employed or present. It is arranged first by GUIDELINES FOR SITES WITHOUT A FN PRESENCE followed by GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE.    Following a lengthy discussion of the guidelines and considerations, the specific checks for this requirement are found, along with the default severity level applicable to each check.  Finally, guidance for applicability to tactical environments is provided.  GUIDELINES FOR SITES WITHOUT A FN PRESENCE:  The following physical controls should be used (individually or collectively) as a guide to evaluate compliance and can be recommended for site use; however, any method or combination of methods clearly being used successfully by the site under review may be acceptable.  POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: 1. The best physical control solution is to locate all US Only classified terminals (open SIPRNet) in areas where only persons with at least a secret (or higher) security clearance have unescorted access. This type of area is commonly known as a secret Controlled Access Area (CAA). Placement of classified terminals in more highly controlled spaces like in secret or top secret (TS) vaults or secure rooms or SCIFs meets the access control requirements of a secret or TS CAA in addition to providing superior physical security of the location. Such additional physical security protection may be appropriate depending on organization mission and need to continually maintain classified information processing equipment within an open storage environment.   2.  Regardless of the type of environment in which classified work stations/monitors are located, ensuring that uncleared persons or those without need-to-know do not have easy access or inadvertent visibility to the classified monitor screens can be accomplished by placing (grouping together) the classified work stations in the back of such rooms/areas or behind partitions. This ensures uncleared visitors have limited opportunity to walk by a classified monitor and inadvertently be exposed to classified data.  3.  If isolation (grouping in controlled space) of the terminals is not practical, a privacy filter should be placed on each classified (SIPRNET) monitor to prevent ease of observation by any unauthorized individual simply passing by. This is a good idea even if other physical controls of classified work stations are used. The use of the privacy filters is an excellent alternative solution where physical separation or repositioning of monitors in rooms is not possible due to space limitations.  4. Classified monitor screens should not be placed facing doorways or windows through which public or unrestricted viewing of the monitor is possible. If space limitations do not allow for such placement then ensuring doors are closed or that windows are covered by screens or blinds during classified processing can be used - but only if this procedure is part of documented security procedures and security training.    5. Finally a solution for areas where work stations (cubes) are used is to place doors or the less costly cube screens across the openings for use when classified work is being conducted.  ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS: While the ""possible solutions"" cover a range of suggest compliance possibilities the following covers an absolute requirement for which there can be no exception:  1.  When uncleared visitors need to enter CAAs, secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs where classified work stations are located there must be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering. This will allow time for screens and classified material to be covered from view.    2.  All uncleared visitors must be under continuous escort by a properly cleared employee while within the CAA/secure room/vault/or SCIF.   GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:    Environments where FN are present (may even be embedded as US DoD employees) require even more diligence and additional considerations for protection of US Only classified (SIPRNet) terminal screens/workstation screens and monitors. This is because while sharing of certain specific classified information may be permitted, there is always the possibility that US Only or NOFORN information may also be present within the physical environment or accessible on visible/unprotected workstation screens.  Foreign Nationals, even if they are embedded partners in US DoD operations, are not afforded access to any and all US classified information. This erroneous assumption is prevalent in many CC/S/A operation centers where FN liaison and exchange personnel are routinely present. Release of US classified information can only be made to FN partners if specifically compliant with National Disclosure Policy, has been determined releasable to the Foreign National's host country and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material.  *Where FN are present (regardless of their authorized physical and systems access or security clearance) - US Only work stations and network equipment must be under strict US control at all times.    This process involves a combination of physical control measures AND employee awareness. Reviewers must use a flexible approach with an understanding of the synergistic relationship of physical controls and employee awareness to properly evaluate compliance.  REGULATORY STANDARD FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE: This relationship of physical protective measures with employee awareness gained through procedures and training is based on the following excerpt from CJCSI 6510-01F:  In areas where there is the potential for Foreign National Access to U.S.-Only Workstations and Network Equipment, CC/S/As shall:  1.  Maintain strict U.S. control of U.S.-only workstations and network equipment at all times. This includes network equipment such as printers, copiers, and faxes.  2.  Group U.S.-only workstations together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers).  3.  If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps shall be taken:      a. The U.S. command or agency shall authorize an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception. NOTE: this exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer.      b. Develop, publish, and maintain specific site written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations.      c. Ensure that U.S. personnel are briefed and enforce security measures.      4.  Announce presence. If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times. In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.  5.  If the foreign national is permitted to view the screen, U.S. personnel must ensure:      a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and shall be consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.      b.  Check with organization security office to ensure foreign national has security clearances granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved and an official need-to-know.  POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: The following physical controls should be used (individually or collectively) as a guide to evaluate compliance and can be recommended for site use; however, any method or combination of methods clearly being used successfully by the site under review may be acceptable:  1.  The ""best physical control solution"" is to locate all US Only terminals in areas where the FN do not have easy access or visibility to the monitor screens. This can be accomplished by placing them in the back of rooms/areas or behind partitions. Normally if US Only SIPRNet PCs are placed in the back of a room or within the secure space the REL/FN  work stations would then be placed near the front of the area to reduce the frequency of FN officers passing by US Only SIPRNet (or other US Only classified) work stations. When FN employees need to enter areas where US Only work stations are located there should be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering. This will allow time for screens and classified material not releasable to FN to be covered from view.  2.  If isolation of the terminals is not practical, a privacy filter should be placed on each US Only classified (SIPRNET) monitor to prevent ease of observation by any unauthorized individual. This is a good idea even if physical separation of US Only and REL/FN work stations is used. The use of the privacy filters is the best alternative ""physical control solution"" where physical separation in rooms is not possible due to space limitations and/or the impeding of interaction between US personnel and FN partners.   3.  Another acceptable physical security alternative solution for areas where work stations (cubes) are used is to place doors or the less costly cube screens across the openings for when classified work (especially on the US Only cubes) is being performed.                                                     4. Finally, in addition to any physical separation, obscuration or other control measures in place (or lack thereof) written local policy/procedures and initial/recurring training are absolutely necessary to ensure that all US personnel are:      a.  Aware of REL/FN Officers presence in common work areas when working on non-releasable applications/sites on the SIPRNet and      b.  Aware of exactly what classified or sensitive information is not releasable.  ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS: While the ""possible solutions"" cover a range of suggest compliance possibilities the following covers an absolute requirement for which there can be no exception:  1.  When uncleared visitors need to enter CAAs, secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs where classified work stations are located there must be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering. This will allow time for screens and classified material to be covered from view.    2.  All uncleared visitors must be under continuous escort by a properly cleared employee while within the CAA/secure room/vault/or SCIF.   3.  Announce presence of Foreign Nationals (FN). If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times. In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.  4. If the foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel must ensure:      a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.      b. A check with the organization security office is conducted to ensure the foreign national has security clearances granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, that an appropriate DDL is on-hand to validate the security clearance and release of US classified information, and that there is an official need-to-know.  CHECKS FOR *BOTH* US ONLY CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT FN PRESENCE AND ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:  1.  CHECK all classified monitor locations to ensure that no unauthorized viewing is possible or occurring. This includes viewing by uncleared persons and/or those w/o need-to-know. It also includes REL partners or other FN who may have been granted liberal physical access to areas where US ONLY classified is processed. This check is the primary action for reviewers under this requirement. (CAT I)  2.  CHECK/validate that classified monitors cannot be observed from outside the secure space (e.g., from common hallways or through doors or windows).  (CAT I)  3.  CHECK access control procedures and observe actual escort procedures. Ensure there is a process (and that it is actually being used) for announcing unauthorized/uncleared personnel in the area and that uncleared persons and/or those without the need-to-know (to include FN)  are continuously escorted when they are in the immediate vicinity of US classified workstations and components. (CAT I)  CHECKS *ONLY FOR* CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITH *FN PRESENCE*:  4.  CHECK to ensure there are local written procedures AND adequate documented proof of training (annually minimum) covering rules for interaction between US and FN employees.  All US and FN employees must be equally aware of the rules and procedures.  BOTH must be provided with applicable written guidance and training in this area. (CAT II)  5.  CHECK that U.S.-only workstations are ""grouped"" together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers). (CAT II)  6.  CHECK that If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps have been taken:      a. The U.S. command or agency has authorized an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception.  This exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer level.  (CAT II)      b. Develop, publish, and maintain site specific written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations. (in conjunction with written procedures required for CHECK #4) (CAT II)      c. Ensure that U.S. personnel are briefed, trained (annually minimum) and enforce security measures.  (in conjunction with training required for CHECK #4) (CAT II)  NOTE:  CHECK #6 is an allowable alternative to CHECK #5 and one or the other must be conducted.  7.  CHECK that if a foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel have ensured:      a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01. (CAT I)      b.  The organization Foreign Disclosure Officer, Foreign Contact Officer, or Security Manager was consulted to  ensure the foreign national has a security clearance granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material, and that there is an official need-to-know. (CAT I)  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:   1. This check is applicable for all classified processing environments including a field/mobile environment. Commanders in such environments may use whatever means available or feasible to control unauthorized physical access to classified monitors.    2.  This check is applicable where REL Partners or other FN allies are employed within fixed facilities located in a theater of operations (tactical environment) with physical access to US Classified or Sensitive Systems.  3.  Wherever classified systems/with screens/monitors are used, uncleared persons must always be escorted when permitted in the physical processing environment. Fix: REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH US ONLY CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT FN PRESENCE AND ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:  1.  All classified information system processing locations must have physical and procedural controls to ensure that no unauthorized viewing of monitor screens is possible or occurring. This includes viewing by uncleared persons and/or those w/o need-to-know.  It also includes REL partners or other FN who may have been granted liberal physical access to areas where US ONLY classified is processed.  This is the primary purpose for this STIG Rule requirement.  2.  Classified monitor screens must not be visible or capable of being observed from outside the secure space (e.g., from common hallways or through doors or windows).    3.  There must be a visitor/escort control procedure in place (that it is actually being used) for announcing unauthorized/uncleared personnel in the area and that uncleared persons and/or those without the need-to-know (to include FN)  are continuously escorted when they are in the immediate vicinity of US classified workstations and components.   REQUIREMENTS ONLY FOR CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:  4.  There must be local written procedures AND adequate documented proof of training (annually minimum) covering rules for interaction between US and FN employees.  All US and FN employees must be equally aware of the rules and procedures.  BOTH must be provided with applicable written guidance and training in this area.  5.  U.S.-only workstations must be ""grouped"" together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers).   6.  If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps must be taken:      a. The U.S. command or agency must authorize an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception.  This exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer level.        b. Develop, publish, and maintain site specific written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations. (in conjunction with written procedures under requirement #4)       c. U.S. personnel must be briefed, trained (annually minimum) and enforce security measures. (in conjunction with training under requirement #4)  NOTE:  Requirement #6 is an allowable alternative to Requirement #5 and one or the other must be conducted.  7.  If a foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel must first ensure:      a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.      b.  The organization Foreign Disclosure Officer, Foreign Contact Officer, or Security Manager must be consulted to  ensure the foreign national has a security clearance granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material, and that there is an official need-to-know."
V-245830,"Monitor Screens - Disable Access by CAC or Token Removal, or Lock Computer via Ctrl/Alt/Del",high,STIG,"Monitor Screens - Disable Access by CAC or Token Removal, or Lock Computer via Ctrl/Alt/Del. The DoD Common Access Cards (CAC) a ""smart"" card, is the standard identification for active-duty military personnel, Selected Reserve, DoD civilian employees, and eligible contractor personnel.  It is also the principal card used to enable physical access to buildings and controlled spaces, and it provides access to defense computer networks and systems.    The card, which is the property of the U.S. Government, is required to be in the personal custody of the member at all times.  System Access Tokens are also used on the SIPRNet and the cards along with a Personal identity Number (PIN) can be used to access classified information on the SIPRNet in lieu of a logon ID and password.  CAC and SIPRNet tokens are very important components for providing both physical and logical access control to DISN assets and must therefore be strictly controlled.  Physically co-locating REL Partners or other FN - who have limited access to the SIPRNet or other US Classified systems - near US personnel in a collateral classified (Secret or higher) open storage area or in a Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA) that processes classified material is permissible for operational efficiency and coordination.    Failure to limit access to information systems is especially important in mixed US/FN environments.   This is particularly important on US Only classified terminals when not personally and physically attended by US personnel.  The failure to properly disable information workstations and monitor screens when unattended can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified information, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information.   Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure that unauthorized persons to include FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them.  Control of CACs, SIPRNet tokens and locking of computer work stations when unattended is an important aspect of proper procedural security measure implementation.

Area verification checks will be recorded on the SF 701 upon completion of end-of-day checks.  Recommended end-of-day checks, which should be included on the SF 701 are:                                                       a.  Activation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensors where applicable. b.  All classified material has been properly stored.  c.  Removal of CAC Cards and SIPRNet tokens from workstations. d.  All windows, doors or other openings are properly secured.                                           e.  Verification of lock box closure for SIPRNet wall jacks and PDS lines, where applicable. f.  Additional checks such as turning off of coffee pots and lights, power-off of printers/MFDs, securing of STE keys, etc. can be identified and accomplished as part of the check. g.  The SF 701, Activity Security Checklist shall be used to record these checks, to include after hours, weekend and holiday activities.                                                 Results of end-of-day checks (SF 701 forms) should be retained for at least 30 days after completion of the monthly form (or otherwise as required by Component records management schedules) to ensure availability for audits and resolution of subsequent discovery of security incidents or discrepancies.                                         TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable in a fixed operational facility in a tactical environment if classified equipment is used or documents or media are created/extracted from the SIPRNet.  The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used. Fix: Ensure that areas where classified information is processed or stored have an established system of security checks implemented at the close of each duty and/or business day to ensure that any area where classified information is used or stored is secure. SF 701, ""Activity Security Checklist,"" must be used to record these checks.   In addition to the SF 701, the responsible site or organization should have a written procedure to outline the end-of-day check process and to guide checkers with their duties. For instance the procedure should include instructions on how to handle any classified information that is found outside of proper storage.  An integral part of the security check system must incorporate the securing of all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material. SF 702, ""Security Container Check Sheet,"" must be used to record each opening, closing, and verification checks of these storage mediums.    Area verification checks will be recorded on the SF 701 upon completion of end-of-day checks.  Following are recommended end-of-day checks, which should be included on the SF 701, but ultimately the checks must be tailored to fit the physical configuration and mission of the site:                                                       a. Activation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensors where applicable. b.  All classified material has been properly stored.                                                      c.  Removal of CAC Cards and SIPRNet tokens from workstations. d.  All windows, doors or other openings are properly secured.                                           e.  Verification of lock box closure for SIPRNet wall jacks and PDS lines, where applicable. f.  Additional checks such as turning off of coffee pots and lights, power-off of printers/MFDs, securing of STE keys, etc. can be identified and accomplished as part of the check. g. The SF 701, Activity Security Checklist shall be used to record these checks, to include after hours, weekend and holiday activities.                                                 Results of end-of-day checks (SF 701 forms) should be retained for at least 30 days (or otherwise as required by Component records management schedules) after completion of the monthly form to ensure availability for audits and resolution of subsequent discovery of security incidents or discrepancies.  While 24/7 operational areas storing classified materials do not necessarily require end-of-day (EOD) checks it is highly recommended that a system of checks be instituted (similar to EOD checks) upon each change of shift.  Such checks jointly conducted by incoming and outgoing supervisors can be used to verify the integrity of safes and classified equipment/materials under their control and can be used to narrow the window of time for a preliminary inquiry should a security incident occur."

Checks:    1.  Unless the MFD can be properly purged and sanitized (made unclassified) of all classified data or images after each use for classified - it must be housed in an area approved for open storage of classified material.    Most current copiers, printers, scanners and facsimile machines or multi-functional devices (MFD) contain hard drives that collect and store images and data.    Therefore check to ensure that such machines are maintained in space approved for open storage of classified (secret or higher for SIPRNet).    NOTE that to be properly sanitized means that the MFD can be treated as an unclassified piece of equipment once a successful purge of data or images is completed. (CAT I)   2.  If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area:    Check that MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) do not have hard drives containing non-volatile memory in the device and that the volatile memory is purged/sanitized of all classified data or images after each use.  Additionally check that these MFD are maintained in space where access is controlled to at least the level of the classified material authorized to be copied on the machine. This type of area is referred to as a Controlled Access Area (CAA) - at least a secret CAA or TS CAA for SIPRNet connections.    ONLY those MFD with entirely volatile memory can be sanitized and reused upon removal of power from the device.    Check to ensure that powering down the machine is a part of the MFD sanitization procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device.  Documented procedures must be on-hand for this process.   NOTE:  Sanitizing a MFD means it can be considered and treated as an unclassified device.  Hard drives with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized by current overwriting/clearing procedures and must be destroyed (degaussing and/or physical destruction) to be considered sanitized/unclassified.  Hence MFD with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized for reuse.  Only MFD with volatile memory can be sanitized for reuse.    Only if ALL of the sub-checks listed under check 2 are compliant is it a CAT II finding.  Otherwise if ANY of the sub-checks are not compliant it remains a CAT I finding. (CAT II)  3.  If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area and hard drives with non-volatile memory are present:   Check to ensure MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) are located in a secret or higher CAA and the hard drive is promptly removed after each use and stored in a GSA approved safe.    Check to ensure that powering down the machine is a required part of this procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device.     Check that documented procedures are on hand to support this process.   Only if ALL of the sub-checks listed under check 3 are compliant is it a CAT II finding.  Otherwise if ANY of the sub-checks are not compliant it remains a CAT I finding.  (CAT II)  EXPLANATION for CAT II FINDINGS:  Despite the mitigations in checks 2 and 3 above, there is still a concern that the mitigation procedure will not be accomplished promptly or successfully each time and there is a risk for printed or copied classified documents to be left unattended for periods of time in the networked MFD machines, especially when printed from a remote workstation location.  Therefore, since a potential vulnerability still exists it is still considered as a CAT II finding.  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable in a fixed operational facility in a tactical environment if classified equipment is used or documents or media are created/extracted from the SIPRNet.  The only exception will be for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used. Fix: This Potential Vulnerability covers multi-functional devices (MFD) (connected to the SIPRNet) that are used for printing, copying or other reproduction of classified DOCUMENTS.     1.  Unless the MFD can be properly purged of all classified data or images after each use for classified - it must be housed in an area approved for open storage of classified material.  Most current copiers, printers, scanners and facsimile machines or multi-functional devices (MFD) contain hard drives that collect and store images and data.    Therefore these machines must be maintained in space approved for open storage of classified (secret or higher for SIPRNet).      NOTE:  Clearing of hard drives (such as by overwriting) is not adequate to sanitize a classified hard drive (magnetic or solid state) so that it can be deemed unclassified and left unattended in an area not approved for classified open storage.  This is regardless of the number of times the drive is over-written.  A hard drive (magnetic or solid state) can only be sanitized (made unclassified) by degaussing and/or physical destruction, thereby rending the drive no longer usable.     2. If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area and hard drives (non-volatile memory) ARE NOT present:    MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) must be properly purged (AKA: sanitized) of classified data or images after each period of reproducing classified and be maintained in space where access is controlled to at least the level of the classified material authorized to be copied on the machine.  This type of area is referred to as a Controlled Access Area (CAA) - at least a secret CAA or TS CAA for SIPRNet connections.   Sanitizing a MFD means it can be considered and treated as an unclassified device.    NOTE:  Hard drives with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized by current overwriting/clearing procedures and must be destroyed to be considered sanitized/unclassified.  Hence MFD with non-volatile memory cannot be sanitized for reuse.    Only those MFD with entirely volatile memory can be sanitized and reused with removal of power from the device.  It is important to note that powering down the machine will be a necessary part of this procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device.  Documented procedures must be on-hand for this process.  3.  If not maintained within a secret or higher collateral classified open storage area and hard drives (non-volatile memory) ARE present:   MFD (or individual copiers, scanners, printers or facsimile machines) with hard drives (non-volatile memory) must be located and operated in a secret or higher CAA and the hard drive must be promptly removed after each use (or otherwise when unattended by cleared employees) and stored in a GSA approved safe.    It is important to note that powering down the machine will still be a necessary part of this procedure to ensure that volatile memory is totally erased and sanitized so that it can be considered to be an unclassified device. There must be documented procedures on-hand for this process.   NOTE:  Despite the mitigations in 2 and 3 above, there is still a concern that the procedure will not be accomplished promptly or successfully each time and that the risk for printed or copied classified documents to be left unattended for periods of time in the MFD machines still exists.  Therefore vulnerability still exists and must be considered as a potential finding."

NOTE 3: The specific methods and procedures for sanitization of classified hard drives or storage media differ depending on sensitivity of data, type of hard drive or storage media (magnetic, solid state, etc...) and ownership of the hard drive or storage media. To ensure DOD information is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security manager should coordinate with the local Authorizing Official (AO) and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for disposal of computer hard drives appropriately address removal of U.S. Government data prior to disposal.  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: Applies in all environments whenever classified documents or materials are to be destroyed. Fix: For CLASSIFIED automated information system (AIS) data processing and/or storage equipment such as hard drives and media:  CLASSIFIED automated information system (AIS) data processing/storage devices such as system hard drives and media must be properly sanitized using approved NSA guidelines (purged of all classified data so that recovery using known laboratory attack is not possible) before such equipment or media is disposed of or placed in use (and/or stored) in a lower classification environment or an unclassified environment.   NOTE 1: Clearing procedures using overwrite software is not sufficient to dispose of classified equipment or media (for instance by release to property disposal, vendors, or placement in trash) or to re-use it in an unclassified or lesser classification environment other than its original classification level. Clearing will only enable the equipment or media to be re-used within the original classified environment.   NOTE 2: NSA guidance for classified equipment can be found in the NSA/CSA Policy Manual 9-12, NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual. Sanitization and disposal must also be IAW Enclosure 3 and Enclosure 7 of Volume 3 of DOD Manual 5200.01, which provides additional clarifying guidance for the DOD.

Unclassified Hard Drives:   a. When no longer needed, unclassified computer systems and hard drives may be disposed of outside the Department of Defense (DOD). In some circumstances, the equipment may be provided to nongovernment entities for reutilization. To ensure that no data or information remains on operable unclassified hard drives that are transferred or permanently removed from DOD custody, the drives must be sanitized by overwriting.   b. Where overwriting is inappropriate or cannot be completely accomplished (e.g., inoperable disk) the drives are to be totally removed from service (i.e., thrown away). In this case the drives must be physically destroyed before disposal.   c. The specific methods and procedures differ depending on sensitivity of data and ownership of the hard drive. To ensure DOD information is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security manager should coordinate with the local DAA and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for disposal of computer hard drives appropriately address removal of U.S. Government data prior to disposal.  Generally the use of hard drive degaussers with an appropriate strength (coercivity of magnetic field) for the drive being erased (Oestrid rating) is recommended as part of the requirement for physical destruction. After degaussing the hard drive, the physical destruction of individual platters should be accomplished to make attempted data retrieval impractical.  2.

Record copies of CUI documents shall be disposed of in accordance with the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 33 and Component records management directives.   b. Nonrecord CUI documents may be destroyed by shredding or tearing into pieces and discarding the pieces in regular trash containers.   c. NOTE: The guidance provided here is for CUI paper documents and this is the least stringent standard found for any CUI document destruction. There are other types of CUI, such as DEA Sensitive material, which must be destroyed by a means approved for destruction of Confidential material. Be certain to check DOD Manual 5200.01 for specific destruction requirements for each type of CUI document.   4. Additional reviewer checks and considerations:  a. Check recycle bins, regular trash, and the availability of shredders or collection containers for sensitive material. Ensure the organization knows who gets the recycling (especially if it contains CUI) and that it is disposed of properly (for instance by shredding). NOTE: If you find (e.g., in the trash) and can easily reconstruct any document marked CUI (or other CUI document) and it contains extremely sensitive information such as PII (with SSN, etc.), this should be made a finding.   b. In all cases the reviewer should recommend using at least a cross cut shredder for destruction of CUI documents. Further, while a shred-all policy is not required, this is another recommendation that should be made.

Check: General Guidance:    Standards of protection for most types of CUI are the same as for FOUO but some variance does exist.  Therefore, specific requirements for certain CUI may need to be checked against applicable references to ensure proper protection is afforded.  The checks are applicable to all forms of CUI: documents, AIS hard drives and storage media.  Checks:  For most CUI and FOUO specifically check to ensure the following standards are met:   Check #1.  During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel.  This would include things like placing cover sheets on FOUO documents and allowing unescorted access to areas where CUI (documents and AIS storage media) is processed/handled to only those persons with at least a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check (NAC).   Check #2.  After working hours, FOUO information (documents and removable media) may be stored in unlocked containers, desks, or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building security is provided. If such building security is not provided or is deemed inadequate, the information (documents and removable media) shall be stored in locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.  In all cases FOUO and other CUI documents must be placed out of sight during non-working hours. While not required, recommending implementation of a clean desk policy would be appropriate.  Check #3.  Unescorted access to computer rooms or areas containing major items of AIS equipment processing CUI information (servers and network components) should only be granted to persons with at least a favorable NAC.  All others should be physically escorted. Access control measures such as reception personnel, guards, keyed locks, cipher locks or automated access control systems may be used to control access to such areas.                                        TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments where procedural documents (SOPs) should be in place.  Not applicable to a field/mobile environment. Fix: General Guidance:    Standards of protection for most types of CUI are the same as for FOUO but some variance does exist.  Therefore, specific requirements for certain CUI may need to be checked against applicable references to ensure proper protection is afforded.  The fixes are applicable to all forms of CUI: documents, AIS hard drives and storage media.  Fixes applicable for FOUO:  For most CUI and FOUO specifically ensure the following standards are met:   1.  During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel.  This would include things like placing cover sheets on FOUO documents and allowing unescorted access to areas where CUI (documents and AIS storage media) is processed/handled to only those persons with at least a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check (NAC).   2.

Check: BACKGROUND: When checking how an organization validates security clearance information for either systems or physical access the first thing to consider is that there are various categories of personnel and associated considerations with each one. These categories include: Military employees, Government Civilian employees, Contract employees, Foreign Nationals, and Local National employees under a Status of Forces (SOFA) agreement and Visitors.   Generally, an organization validation of security clearance levels should come from official databases such as DISS, DCII, a service or agency data base or ""high level"" (major subordinate command) headquarters security office. Also note that organization manning (staffing) documents should include the required clearance level for each assigned Military and Civilian position. Staffing documents should be requested by inspectors for review.  The minimum security clearance requirement for systems access to the SIPRNet or unescorted access to the physical environment surrounding SIPRNet system information technology assets is secret.  Local procedures must be developed for verifying that all personnel with access to classified information systems (logical or physical access) have the appropriate security clearance and access authorization. Inspectors should review local procedures.  Checks:  Check #1. Review a sample of the organization personnel security records (from local data bases, physical files, DISS...) and compare with applicable System Access Authorization Request (SAAR) forms to ensure proper validation of clearance levels for access to the SIPRNet (both logical systems access and/or physical access to SIPRNet environments). Minimum of secret security clearance is required. Check organizational records against the DISS data base if possible. Ensure that organizational manning records (security clearance requirements for the position occupied) match the actual security clearance held by the incumbent employee (military or DOD civilian) as reflected in DISS.   Because it is generally not feasible to review all records it is recommended to select where possible ALL those who have privileged systems access or responsibility for oversight of systems security (such as SAs, ISSM, ISSOs, Network Admin, etc.) along with key management personnel (commander/director, ISSM, division/branch chiefs, etc.) and supplement with a random sample of those with basic ""user"" access to systems.  Check #2. If there are contractor employees with classified systems access (SIPRNet) (both logical and/or physical access) - check to ensure there is a Statement of Work with accompanying DD 254 (""Classified"" Contract Security Specification) that covers security clearance requirements for each type of work (or specified positions) being performed by contractors.   Check #3. Check to ensure that contractor employees performing the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work and/or DD Form 254 actually have the security clearance required by the contract - minimum secret for SIPRNet access. If possible validate this in the DISS data base.  Check #4. Check that a delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL) is on-hand in all cases where US Classified information is released/shared with Foreign National Exchange or Liaison personnel who are either assigned to or visiting the site. The DDL will reflect the level of security clearance the FN official has and the level and type of information authorized to be shared.  Check #5. Check to ensure that a Limited Access Authorization (LAA) is on hand when system access (or physical access) to classified information is granted to an immigrant alien or a foreign national - not associated with or representing a foreign government.   TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments and is also applicable to a field/mobile environment. Fix: Background Information:  When developing an organizational program to validate security clearance information for systems access and/or physical access to SIPRNet work environments, the first thing to consider is there are various categories of personnel and associated considerations with each one. These categories include: Military employees, Government Civilian employees, Contract employees, Foreign Nationals and Local National employees under a Status of Forces (SOFA) agreement and Visitors.   The minimum security clearance requirement for systems access to the SIPRNet or unescorted access to the physical environment surrounding SIPRNet system information technology assets is secret.  Generally, an organization validation of security clearance levels should come from official databases such as DISS, DCII, a service or agency data base or ""high level"" (major subordinate command) headquarters security office. Also note that organization manning (staffing) documents should include the required clearance level for each assigned Military and Civilian position.  Local procedures must be developed for verifying that all personnel with access to classified information systems (logical or physical access) have the appropriate security clearance and access authorization.   Fixes:  1. Ensure that organizational manning (staffing) records (*security clearance requirements for the position occupied) match the actual security clearance held by the incumbent employee (military or DOD civilian) as reflected in DISS. Review all the organization personnel security records and compare with applicable System Access Authorization Request (SAAR) forms to ensure proper validation of clearance levels. Be especially aware of ALL those who have ""privileged"" systems access or responsibility for systems security oversight (such as SAs, ISSM, ISSOs, Network Admin, etc.) and ensure that correct clearance and IT assurance levels have been granted.  2. If there are contract employees with systems and/or physical access to SIPRNet, ensure there is a Statement of Work with accompanying DD 254 (Contract Security Specification) that covers security clearance requirements for each type of work being performed by contractors. Review contractor records (those physical assigned to the site or working remotely on projects for the organization) to ensure they actually have the required security clearances.  3. Ensure that a delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL) is on-hand in all cases where US Classified information is released/shared with Foreign National Exchange or Liaison personnel.   4. Ensure that a Limited Access Authorization (LAA) is on hand when system access to classified information is granted to an immigrant alien or a foreign national - not associated with or representing a foreign government.   5. Ensure there is an organizational procedure developed to outline methodology for validation and maintenance of required security clearances."

Check: 1. Check to ensure there is a Physical Security Plan (PSP), either an organizational/site AND/OR an installation security plan in which granular security concerns and procedures at the site are addressed and considered.   NOTE 1:  If a higher level installation or base plan is used ensure that it specifically addresses security concerns/procedures for the inspected organization or site.  Ideally, a local site or organization should always be included in the host installation security plan. If not, then a separately developed local (site/organization) Physical Security Plan (and/or Systems Security Plan (SSP)) is required, which integrates local security procedures for the site with the security-in-depth (SID) measures detailed in the host installation PSP.  The installation level PSP will likely not address granular security concerns for computer rooms and areas hosting information systems assets at individual installation sites.  Therefore the local organization(s) should still document specific protection measures covering SIPRNet and/or NIPRNet assets in a local PSP or in an SSP.      2.

NOTE 1: While an AO signed ATO does in fact signify acceptance of risk for specific systems, this alone does not meet the requirement for a formal risk assessment, which is a very specific and separate individual document.                                       NOTE 2: Conducting a risk analysis is not just a simple paper work drill - or at least it should not be.  Often organizations take a risk analysis template and simply insert their organizations information, local environmental information, etc. - but do not do a good job of actually assessing threats, countermeasures in place (or that can be applied) to come up with an acceptable level of residual risk.  A good risk assessment is a team effort (security, IA, COOP, engineers, safety, management...) and should be headed by someone with at least some training in conducting risk assessments.    NOTE 3: Training is offered by the Defense Security Service (DSS) Academy in Linthicum, MD among others.    NOTE 4:  The NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments provides a widely used format and instructions for conducting a RA.  Reviewers should recommend sites use this publication as the basis for conducting their RA.  NOTE 5: Time permitting the reviewer should make recommendations for improving the risk analysis process at a site since this is a critical element in any effective security management program.  NOTE 6:  When there is a government/DoD contract with an industry partner; the government sponsor is inherently and ultimately responsible for risk based decisions.  The contractor only performs mission related tasks IAW contract specifications (e.g., statement of work (SOW)), which should ideally include guidance for risk assessment and acceptance.    Hence, while the industry partner can prepare and coordinate the risk assessment it is the government/DoD customer who has the ultimate responsibility for accepting and coordinating risk based on their mission requirements. Therefore, the head of the contract sponsoring organization must approve/sign the risk assessment/acceptance of residual risk.  The Authorizing Official (AO) for industry locations is the Defense Security Service (DSS) Cognizant Security Office (CSO).  Each CSO appoints an AO for system related risk evaluation.    NOTE 7:  A thorough organizational risk assessment and acceptance of residual risk should be properly coordinated with all stakeholders to ensure there are no conflicts or issues.

CNSSI No.7003, September 2015, Protected Distribution Systems (PDS), Section IV, paragraph 6, Section VIII, Table 1 and Table 2, and Section VI - DEFINITIONS - Controlled Access Area (CAA). Check: Background Information:  This set of checks is intended to validate security-in-depth protection measures in place for facilities with either Unclassified DoDIN assets (NIPRNet) or Classified (SIPRNet) DoDIN assets or both.  Checks are specifically oriented to each (one or more) of the following 4-situations:  1.  Protection of unclassified (NIPRNet) assets (such as-end user workstations with typical office equipment - PC/laptop/thin client/multi-functional devices (MFD), printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machine...) that are housed and operated in administrative office spaces.  2.  Protection of unclassified (NIPRNet) assets housed and operated in unclassified computer rooms.  This check is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, DASD, etc., rather than end user workstations.  This high level system equipment requires an additional layer of physical protection and access control.  3.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets (such as end-user workstations with typical office equipment - PC/laptop/thin client/multi-functional devices (MFD), printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machine...) that are housed and operated in administrative office spaces NOT designated for collateral classified open storage (AKA: secure room or closed storage area).  Normally such space should be controlled/designated as secret controlled access areas (CAA) for SIPRNet.  4.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets housed and operated in space designated for collateral classified open storage (AKA: secure room or closed storage area).  Assets in this situation may include both end-user workstations with typical office equipment as detailed above and/or Computer Rooms containing key system assets such as servers, routers, DASD, etc.  So to restate, this includes any classified equipment (both end-user and key system equipment) stored and operated in space designated for and meeting collateral classified open storage standards. Where both NIPRNet and SIPRNet assets as well as end-user and system level assets are co-located in a facility - the most stringent SID standards applicable for the area will be used.  Checks:  1. Protection of areas containing unclassified (NIPRNet) assets (such as end user workstations): Check that any facility (building, room or area) housing  unclassified information system assets connected to the DODIN (such as end user NIPRNet work stations) has at least one physical barrier supplemented by any type of 24/7 access control (keyed locks, reception, guards, Access Control System, Cipher Locks, etc.).  2.  Protection of unclassified (NIPRNet) assets housed and operated in unclassified computer rooms:  Check to ensure that Unclassified Computer Rooms containing equipment connected to the DoDIN (located within a facility (building, room or area) meeting the standard in #1 above) have an additional layer of physical protection and access control (beyond that for the surrounding facility or area). This check is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, etc., rather than end user workstations.    3.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets (such as end user workstations with typical office equipment that are NOT housed and operated within a facility designated as a collateral classified open storage area):      a.  Check to ensure that every physical access point to facilities housing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information is guarded or alarmed 24/7 (minimum of alarm contacts on the doors) and that intrusion alarms are properly monitored.  This is space NOT designated as a collateral classified open storage area.  Normally such space should be access controlled/designated as a secret controlled access area (CAA) for SIPRNet.      b.  Check that two forms of identification are required to gain access to a facility housing DoDIN workstations that process or display classified information (e.g., key card with PIN/biometrics or two acceptable forms of picture ID presented to a guard or receptionist).       c.  Check to ensure that a visitor log is maintained for facilities containing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information. Automated Entry Control System (AECS) log entries may be used to meet this requirement.  NOTE:  Physical access points to facilities housing DoDIN workstations in secret CAAs that process or display classified information, which are located on an access controlled military installation (or that employ another layer of physical barrier/access control) are not required to have an IDS alarm contact on the doors and need only one level of access control.  For instance access control to the facility using only a swipe or proximity card (w/o PIN or biometrics) or a guard checking a single picture ID is acceptable.  4.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets housed and operated in space designated for collateral classified open storage (AKA: secure room or closed storage area):  *Check to ensure that the senior agency official (SAO) has determined in writing that security-in-depth (SID) exists.  Note that the SAO for the Defense Security Service (DSS)/industry is the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA)/Cognizant Security Office (CSO).  SID Explained:   SID is a determination that the security program consists of layered and complementary security controls sufficient to deter and detect unauthorized entry and movement within the facility. Examples include, but are not limited to, use of perimeter fences, employee and visitor access controls, use of an IDS, random guard patrols throughout the facility during non-working hours, closed circuit video monitoring or other safeguards that mitigate the vulnerability of open storage areas without alarms as well as for security containers (safes) during non-working hours.    Specific Secure Room security standards are not covered under this check for security-in-depth as they are covered in other Rules within this STIG.    Selection of supplementary controls for secure rooms (IDS versus 4-hours guard checks) is based upon the SID in conjunction with an assessment of risk that is accepted by the SAO.    Access control requirements for collateral open storage areas are established and must be IAW the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and as implemented by Rules in this STIG.  An SID determination may be rendered using one of two methods:    First, the SAO can issue SID approvals on a case-by-case basis.  For instance the facility or organization with collateral open storage space would provide the SAO with a request for SID (IAW pre-established organizational (CC/S/A) procedures) that is subsequently approved or disapproved by the SAO.    A second method would be for the CC/S/A to establish a policy (Manual, Instruction, Regulation, Circular, etc.) that provides specific criteria or requirements that when met by organizations is evidence of adequate SID for collateral open storage spaces.  Criteria may be based on additional considerations such threat environments (high, medium, or low), if the space is on access controlled installations versus off-installations in public accessible space, CONUS versus OCONUS sites or other such considerations per the discretion of the SAO of the CC/S/A.    Regardless of the method used by the SAO to render an SID determination, it must be properly documented and clearly apply to the collateral open storage area (AKA: secure room or closed storage area) being evaluated.  TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments.  Not applicable to a field/mobile environment. Fix: Background Information:  This standard is intended to validate security-in-depth protection measures in place for facilities containing either unclassified DoDIN assets (NIPRNet) or classified (SIPRNet) DoDIN assets or both.  The first two fixes are specifically for unclassified DoDIN facilities, while fixes 3 and 4 are for facilities containing SIPRNet assets.  Where both NIPRNet and SIPRNet assets are contained in a facility - the more stringent standards for SIPRNet will be used.  Fixes:  1. Ensure that any facility/building housing unclassified information system assets connected to the DoDIN (such as end-user NIPRNet work stations) has at least one physical barrier supplemented by any type of 24/7 access control (keyed locks, reception, guards, Access Control System, Cipher Locks, etc.).  2. Ensure that unclassified Computer Rooms containing equipment connected to the DoDIN (located within a facility (building, room or area) meeting the standard in #1 above) have an additional layer of physical protection and access control. This fix is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, DASD, etc., rather than end user workstations.    3.  Protection of classified (SIPRNet) assets (such as end user workstations with typical office equipment that are NOT housed and operated within a facility designated as a collateral classified open storage area):      a.  Ensure that every physical access point to facilities housing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information is guarded or alarmed 24/7 (minimum of alarm contacts on the doors) and that intrusion alarms are properly monitored.  This is space NOT designated as a collateral classified open storage area.  Normally such space should be controlled/designated as a secret controlled access area (CAA) for SIPRNet.      b.  Ensure that two forms of identification are required to gain access to a facility housing DoDIN workstations that process or display classified information (e.g., key card with PIN/biometrics or two acceptable forms of picture ID presented to a guard or receptionist).       c.  Ensure that a visitor log is maintained for facilities containing DoDIN end-user workstations that process or display classified information. Automated Entry Control System (AECS) log entries may be used to meet this requirement.  NOTE:  Physical access points to facilities housing DoDIN workstations in secret CAAs that process or display classified information, which are located on an access controlled military installation (or that employ another layer of physical barrier/access control) are not required to have an IDS alarm contact on the doors and need only one level of access control.  For instance access control to the facility using only a swipe or proximity card (w/o PIN or biometrics) or a guard checking a single picture ID is acceptable.  4.  Where there are Information System assets stored in secure rooms (AKA: collateral classified open storage areas) that are connected to the SIPRNet - ensure that the senior agency official has determined in writing that security-in-depth exists.   *Note that the SAO for the Defense Security Service (DSS)/industry is the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA)/Cognizant Security Office (CSO)."
